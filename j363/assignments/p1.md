# Project One - <small>Site Structure</small>
## Description
For this project, you will practice using elements such as `<main>` and `<div>` to structure your site.

You will use text and images provided to you. They will be present in the starter files that you download.

Your finished product should look something like [this](hw1-finished.pdf).

## Instructions
First, download the starter files. You can disregard the '.DS_Store' file that will appear in some of the folders.

  <div class="card-block">
    <p class="card-text">Starter files for Project One.</p>
    <a href="p1-start.zip" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">Download</a>
  </div>

I have provided _images_ and _style_ (CSS) for this project. You will have to create the HTML elements that make the site layout.

### index.html
This is the only page you will need to edit. Pay close attention to the code comments; they indicate where start and end tags for your elements should go.

### Site container
In between the opening/closing `<body>` tags, add a `<div>` with class "container". Everything will go in here.

### Header and Navigation
Make a `<header>`.

Inside of that, make a `<nav>`. Inside the nav, make three `<a>` elements. These will link to the beginning/middle/end sections. For example:

```html
<a href="#traits">Traits</a>
```
This will link to an element with `id` of "beginning":

```html
<section id="traits">
    ...
</section>
```

Remember to use `lowercase` when setting ids and classes.

### Main area
Create a `<main>` element. Inside of that, you will have four `<section>` elements. One of them is done for you. The others are _traits_, one for _behavior_, and one for _nutrition_. Each section will have an `id` attribute set that corresponds to the links in the `<nav>`.

Inside your `article`, you will use `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, and `<img>` elements. Make sure that your `img` elements link to the images correctly. Example:

```html
<img src="img/llama1.png" alt="A llama">
```

This will link to a file named `llama1.png` inside the folder named `img`.

Your `p` elements should contain the text from `text.txt`.

### Footer
Create a `<footer>`. Inside that, make a `<p>` element. Inside that, make a `<small>` element. Put the copyright symbol with "Copyright All About Llamas".

Remember that the copyright symbol is an [HTML entity](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp); make sure that you use the proper code for this.

### Setting IDs for your h2s
You will have three `<h2>` elements in your document - beginning, middle, and end. Set each of them with an id that matches this. If done properly - clicking the navigation links in your `<header>` should take you to the corresponding `<h2>` element.

### Linking the stylesheet
There is a file included called `styles.css`. In the `<head>` of your document, use the `<link>` tag to include this stylesheet. You should notice that the appearance of the site changes after doing so. See section "External References" of [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp).

## Grading and Requirements
Project one is worth `ten points`. Grading criteria are detailed below.

### File and Folder names `1 pts.`
 * DO NOT use spaces in your filenames. Use hyphens instead
 * DO NOT use capital letters in your filenames
 * Make sure your HTML file is called `index.html`. This is the standard filename for a site
 * Your site folder should be named `p1_lastname-firstname` _(e.g., hw1_aguirre-nicolas)_
 * You will submit a `.zip` file. Right click on your site folder and choose `compress`. Make sure this file is called `p1_lastname-firstname.zip`

### Code Quality `2 pts.`
Your code should:

 * Be free of extraneous whitespaces
 * Use proper indentation to show structure with nested tags - It should be easy to read for me
 * Follow conventions described in class and in the reading _(e.g., do not capitalize tags, use quotation marks when specifying an attribute)_
 * Match the comments that I provided

Your tags should be:

 * Written in lower case
 * Properly nested; don't start another tag before closing the one you're in
 * Indented to line up properly

### Header, nav, links, and IDs `2 pts.`
Your header content should:

 * Be in a `<header>` tag
 * Contain a `nav` element with working links
 * Your navigation links should have an href attribute that takes you to the corresponding `h2` element. (e.g., clicking "traits" in the nav takes you to the `h2` called "traits")
 * Your `<h2>` elements should each have an ID attribute that matches the links in your navigation.
 * Remember that classes and ids are always written in lowercase

### Main `2 pts.`
Your main content should:

 * Be in a `<main>` tag
 * Contain headings, paragraphs, and images

### Footer `1 pts.`
Your footer content should:

 * Contain a `<small>` tag
 * Contain the copyright symbol, as an HTML entity

### Images `2 pts.`
 * Make sure all image files are included in submission
 * Your `<img>` tag's `src` attribute should correctly reference the image
 * Your image should be reasonably sized. If it's too big/small, use the `width` and `height` attributes to adjust


## Submission - Canvas
