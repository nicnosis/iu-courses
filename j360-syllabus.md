# J360 WEB DESIGN - FALL 2016

**SECTION** - 14173  
**ROOM** - FF 060  
**TIME** - MW 8:30a - 10:30a  
**INSTRUCTOR** - Nicolas Aguirre - naguirre@indiana.edu  
**OFFICE HOURS** - FF M130S (Stack 4), Friday 10:00-11:00a 

## Description
Web design has a profound impact on our everyday experiences of work, recreation, and communication. This course focuses on developing practical, marketable skills for front-end web development. Fundamentally, this course focuses on **experience** and **design** as they relate to web development; technical details and coding are secondary. The internet is constantly evolving - sometimes in a way that is seemingly unpredictable and erratic. Upon completion of this course, students will have a strong foundation of the technical and design skills necessary to produce pleasant web experiences, and the skills to adapt to a constantly-changing medium.

## Objectives
In this course, you will:

 * Learn principles of design and usability for web development
 * Develop mastery of tools and applications for elegant web design
 * Gain familiarity with the software development process
 * Build an effective workflow and digital work environment
 * Understand project management and version control for your code
 * Produce aesthetic and functional websites using `HTML/CSS/JavaScript`
 * Know how to develop for different platforms (mobile, responsive)
 * Have numerous attractive portfolio pieces
 * Gain a demonstrable command of front-end web languages
 * Learn to adapt to a constantly-changing medium

## Work
This class is project-driven, and demands consistent effort inside and outside of the classroom. Classes are intended to be variable and may feature lectures, tutorials, in-class exercises, discussions and lab time. Coverage of technical details such as code syntax is primarily handled outside of the classroom. Class time will generally be utilized to work on projects and review progress.

### Projects
You will be responsible for completing five projects, which will constitute 75% of your grade. Each project will require critical thinking and analysis, prototyping and design, and also a good amount of coding.

### In-class Activities
Participation is an important element of this class. It is not enough to read about web design and its constituent languages; one must actively practice and hone their skills to be successful. Many of our classes will focus on the completion of certain exercises, tutorials, and discussions. 

## GRADE

[img]
There are a total of **100** points in this class. The grade is divided as follows:

**75%** - Five projects (**15%**) each.  
**15%** - Attendance and participation  
**10%** - One tutorial or presentation
		  
## Projects
You will complete three assigned projects

## Analysis, Critiques, Revisions  
Following the completion of each project, students and the instructor will assess each individual submission. The intent is to spur meaningful discussion about design, and attract new ideas and opportunities for improvement. Because web development is an iterative process, students are allowed to revise and resubmit assignments. 



## Required Readings and Materials

There are no required readings, but the following are highly recommended:

 * *Don't Make Me Think: Revisited* by Steve Krug
 * Access to *Lynda.com*

### Software
Software is a focal point of this course, and an effort was made to ensure that free, cross-platform software will be used wherever possible. Tools, applications, and services prove invaluable in web development. A good deal of class time will be spent assisting students with installation and configuration of software.  

We will use:  

 1. A text editor - Webstorm is recommended. Good alternatives are SublimeText and TextWrangler.  
 2. A terminal emulator - While optional, this is highly advised and accelerates workflow.  
 3. A means of version control - GitHub is recommended, Google Drive and Dropbox are good alternatives.  
 4. A way to host your content - GitHub Pages is recommended. You can also purchase a domain and hosting services through a domain provider such as JustHost.  

### Hardware needs  
While web development can be done from any operating system, the instructor teaches workflow for OS X users. Access to a computer with Mac OS X is highly recommended. All students should have access to a Mac through the computer lab. Students who aren't using OS X will not benefit as much from lectures and tutorials. 

It is also useful to have access to a large display, or dual display configuration. 


## POLICIES


## SCHEDULE
Schedule is subject to change. The last half of the semester is more variable as students will have their choice of projects.
