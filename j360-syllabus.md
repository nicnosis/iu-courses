**SECTION** - 14173  
**ROOM** - FF 060  
**TIME** - MW 8:30a - 10:30a

## DESCRIPTION
Web design has a profound impact on our everyday experiences of work, recreation, and communication. This course focuses on developing practical, marketable skills for front-end web development. Fundamentally, this course focuses on **experience** and **design** as they relate to web development; technical details and coding are secondary. The internet is constantly evolving - sometimes in a way that is seemingly unpredictable and erratic. Upon completion of this course, students will have a strong foundation of the technical and design skills necessary to produce pleasant web experiences, and the skills to adapt to a constantly-changing medium.

## OBJECTIVES
In this course, you will:

 * Learn principles of design and usability for web development
 * Develop mastery of tools and applications for elegant web design
 * Gain familiarity with the software development process
 * Build an effective workflow and digital work environment
 * Understand project management and version control for your code
 * Produce aesthetic and functional websites using `HTML/CSS/JavaScript`
 * Know how to develop for different platforms (mobile, responsive)
 * Have numerous attractive portfolio pieces
 * Gain a demonstrable command of front-end web languages
 * Learn to adapt to a constantly-changing medium

## WORK
This class is project-driven, and demands consistent effort inside and outside of the classroom. Classes are intended to be variable and may feature lectures, tutorials, in-class exercises, discussions and lab time. Coverage of technical details such as code syntax is primarily handled outside of the classroom. Class time will generally be utilized to work on projects and review progress.

### PROJECTS
You will be responsible for completing five projects, which will constitute 75% of your grade. Each project will require critical thinking and analysis, prototyping and design, and also a good amount of coding.

### IN-CLASS ACTIVITIES
Participation is an important element of this class. It is not enough to read about web design and its constituent languages; one must actively practice and hone their skills to be successful. Many of our classes will focus on the completion of certain exercises, tutorials, and discussions.
