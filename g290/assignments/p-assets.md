# Project Two - <small>Interface with Assets</small> `15 pts.`
## Description
In Project One, you created a minimal wireframe (low-fidelity prototype) for a game.

In Project Two, you will work in teams to create a more polished prototype. Assets should be (somewhat) indicative of their final states.

The `three main differences` between this project and the last one are:

1. You are constrained to a theme this time
2. You are working in teams
3. This prototype needs to be more polished

## Process
### Ideation and Sketching
You should have chosen your theme, a narrative interpretation of this theme, and have some idea of the game's genre.

You should present wireframes early on so you can elicit feedback from the instructor and the other teams.

### Asset Generation
You will use Illustator, Photoshop, or anything else you like, to create the screens for your game. Choose dimensions before starting and stick to them. If you're not sure what to use, I'd recommend `1280 by 768 pixels`.

There is `no required number of assets`, but the general rule is:

 * If you have fewer assets/screens/visual elements, then they should be high quality and detailed
 * If you have more assets/screens/visual elements, then they can be prototypical and less polished

### Build Prototype
Use InVision _(or other software)_ to create your prototype. You are expected to begin working early so that you can get feedback and suggestions before the due date. If you have already used InVision for your first project, you might need to use another account _(InVision only allows for one prototype per account)_.

If you are working from your personal computer, you might consider using [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html). You can download [sign in to Adobe](https://accounts.adobe.com/) to get the Creative Cloud software and install XD.

## Submission - Canvas
I need two things:

1. You will submit your project on Canvas a URL. You will give me your InVision/Axure shareable URL for this project. If you are using InVision, make sure to add me as a collaborator— `naguirre (at) indiana.edu`
2. You will give me your assets. For most of you, this will mean giving me your `.ai` (Illustrator) files.
