# Project One - <small>Interface Prototype</small> `15 pts.`
## Description
You will create a game interface prototype with multiple screens. I recommend using InVision, but you can use Adobe XD, Axure, or anything else that generates an interactive prototype.

The idea of this project is:

1. To get comfortable with wireframing and prototyping
2. To communicate a game concept to colleagues; you should be able to give an idea of what the game experience is like from a few screens
3. To explore game design from a usability perspective
4. To foster a pleasant interaction experience for the player
5. To generate a portfolio piece

## Process
### 1) Ideation and Sketching
First, come up with an idea. Any type of game is fine, but I recommend one where:

1. Screens and interface change throughout the course of gameplay
2. Interface interaction is a major part of the game
3. Buttons, menus, text, and other interface components are plentiful

### 2) Asset Generation
You will use Illustator, Photoshop, or anything else you like, to create the screens for your game. Choose dimensions before starting and stick to them. If you're not sure what to use, I'd recommend `1280 by 768 pixels`.

### 3) Build Prototype
Use InVision _(or other software)_ to create your prototype. You are expected to begin working early so that you can get feedback and suggestions before the due date.

## Submission - Canvas
I need two things:

1. You will submit your project on Canvas a URL. You will give me your InVision/Axure shareable URL for this project. If you are using InVision, make sure to add me as a collaboratorâ€” `naguirre (at) indiana.edu`
2. You will give me your assets. For most of you, this will mean giving me your `.ai` (Illustrator) files.
