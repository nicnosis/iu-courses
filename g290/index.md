#### Homework One
 * You will begin Homework One. You need to find a `game, app, or website` with poor user experience and be ready to discuss it on `Wednesday, Jan 17th`. The point is to find something with horrific UX so that we can confer as a class on a better solution.
 * If you're not sure where to start, some recommendations are:
   * Game— _A Boy and His Blob(1989)_
   * Game— _Donkey Kong 64_
   * Game— _Superman 64_
