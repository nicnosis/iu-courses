# J362 - Project 1
---------

For Project 1, you will design an album cover in Illustrator.  
This assignment is designed to be enjoyed as a `creative and exploratory endeavor`, rather than a task with stringent constraints.


You will use this project to apply your knowledge of:

* Color scheming
* Grids and composition
* Type, font, and text


## Requirements
Use [this file](p1_starter.ai) to start with. You'll be making five artboards:

1. One artboard that contains `five color palettes`
2. Three **grid layouts** (each on a separate artboard.) 
3. One artboard with your final product - an album cover artwork for a fictitious musical artist.

The above file may not work for some of you. That's fine - create a new document in Illustrator with five artboards, 1000x1000 pixels, and you will have essentially the same thing.

### Color Palettes
Your first artboard will feature five color palettes, each with about five different colors.  
You are highly encouraged to use [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com) as a source of inspiration. Look for images with polarizing or enticing colors and design your palettes based on them.

Use at least `one analogous` and `one complementary` palette.

For finding and refining your color schemes, these sites will prove useful:

* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - interactive tool for palette generation. You can use the [create from photo](https://color.adobe.com/create/image/) section to generate palettes from an uploaded image.
* [color.adobe](http://color.adobe.com) - Adobe's color palette tool. Remember that you can use the **explore** section to find some interesting palettes.
* [Pictaculous](http://www.pictaculous.com/) and [PaletteGenerator](http://palettegenerator.com/) - get a sample color palette by uploading an image.
* For Mac users - [Sip](http://sipapp.io/) is a remarkable tool for sampling colors. You can use it to get a color sample (i.e., eyedropper), and it will return the hex code.

If you have an **adobe ID** and access to Creative Cloud, it is highly recommended to use it for maintaining your color palettes.

### Grids, Type, and Composition
Arrange three grids (each on their own artboard) and use them to arrange text. There is no requirement for what text should be used, or how many words/passages you need to have. The idea is to experiment with text placement and font styling in order to better understand what makes for an aesthetically pleasing composition.

You will use the **split into grid** command in Illustrator, along with the **turn into guide** (CMD+5) command to create structural grids for typographic components. Use [lorem ipsum](http://lipsum.com/) as your sample text. Have `at least one sans serif and one serif` font. Experiment with different font weights and styles (e.g. bold, italic, light, dark). 



<h3 style="color:#ff4a14">UPDATE</h3>
Many of you expressed concern about the grid/typography part of this project. I've included a sample file of some possible arrangements. Feel free to use the 'Common Typographic Disorders' text, or the Lorem Ipsum if you prefer.

Resources:

* [Thinking With Type](http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/contents/grid/) has a detailed and thorough explanation of grids and text arrangement.
* [FontPair](http://fontpair.co/) features popular font pairing options. Often, one font is used for headings, and another for body text.
* The [Google Webfonts Typographic Project](https://femmebot.github.io/google-type/) features some inspiring and novel uses of typography.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) allows you to browse fonts that are free to download. Also suggests font pairings.

### Assembling the Elements

It's difficult and intimidating to approach a blank artboard with no clear vision of what you want to illustrate. By using your palettes, grids, and font selection, you can conjure a compelling piece of imagery.

It's recommended to look at existing album art, gig posters, and flatstock for inspiration. Often, modeling our work after other successful artwork can provide direction and insight in your endeavors.

I strongly recommend saving different versions of your work - this will allow you to revert to a previous version if you make a mistake, and it will also give you a basis to present your creative process in your portfolio. Remember that many employers are more interested in your creative _process_ rather than your creative _products_.
