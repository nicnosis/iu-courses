# j362 - Project 4: Twine Game
## Description

You will work in teams to create an interactive, non-linear Twine story. Your twine story is designed to make readers feel a certain emotion or set of emotions - this will be randomly assigned to you. You must also use at least one character, generated at random from the spreadsheet that we created. Teams will periodically review one another's work, and everyone will meet on the date of the final to present their stories.

## Requirements
1. Story must evoke at least one emotion from your assigned list
2. Story must contain at least one character from your assigned list
3. Story must contain at least two endings
4. Story should be designed to take readers about 5 minutes to complete (10 at the most)
