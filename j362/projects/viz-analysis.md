# j360 - Visualization Analysis Exercise
## Description
This is a class exercise in which groups will `analyze`, `deconstruct`, and `critique` data visualizations. This in-class exercise isn't graded; it's to prepare for Project 3 - a written assignment with similar principles.

## Groups
Groups will be assigned randomly, by selection of a playing card. Each group will have a visualization story provided to them:

* Aces - [Information is Beautiful - Gender Pay Gap in the US](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/gender-pay-gap-us/)
* 2s - [Tampa Bay Times - Failure Factories](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/chart-failing-black-students/)
* 3s - [New York Times - What China Has Been Building in the South China Sea](http://nyti.ms/1KDinEr)
* 4s - [New York Times - 1.5 Million Missing Black Men](http://nyti.ms/1P5Gpa7)

## Process
`Individual` -> `Group` -> `Class`

### Individual - Reading <small>(10-15 min)</small>
First, each group member will read the story as individuals. Because people process information differently, it is important that each member takes time to read and analyze the story individually; this will provide more valuable contributions to the group's effort.

### Group - Analysis and Discussion <small>(20min)</small>
Groups will discuss topics (provided below), encouraged to find areas where individuals agree and disagree. **There are no wrong answers.** Good data viz stories are designed to make stories accessible to **as many people possible**, and you are all readers with valid opinions, perspectives, and viewpoints.

#### Topics


### Class - Sharing <small>(5min per group)</small>
After group discussions, each group will share briefly about their experience with the story, presenting their findings and opinions to the class as a whole. The instructor and other class members will participate in the discussion, contributing ideas and observations.
