# j362 Presentation

## Description
You will give an informal presentation, about 3-5 minutes long, about a topic related to visual design, journalism, data visualization, storytelling, or anything else covered in the course. Your presentation should touch on something we discussed in class and be relevant to topics we've covered, but you may discuss related topics. For example, we didn't cover Photoshop but your presentation may talk about a feature in Photoshop. The idea behind these presentations is that students will do some research about a subject related to design/media and share it with others. Be prepared to answer any questions that other students and the instructor may have.

## Format
It is recommended that you either hook your laptop up to the classroom monitor (via HDMI cable) or use the lab computer to project. You can use PowerPoint slides if you like, but it isn't required. You are not required to dress formally; casual attire is fine. One approach is to keep a Google Presentation online, and then open it from the classroom desktop computer on the day of the presentation. It is recommended to do your presentation in one of the following formats:

1. Tutorial/demonstration
2. Review/demonstration of a program/app
3. Review of a site with useful resources
4. Overview of a concept (e.g. golden rectangle)

## Subject Matter
Anything loosely related to what we've covered in the course is acceptable. Anything that relates to visual design - typography, fonts, color schemes - is perfectly fine. Any topic on the subject of journalism is fine also.

I have provided a list of topics that should provide more than enough starting points. You do not need to know everything about the topic, but you should be able to provide students with a basic overview of the topic. Providing a tutorial; something actionable and useful to other students; is also a strong guarantor of success. Discussing workflow is a good idea as well - e.g., how did you set up your program/document to work on a project? You can reveal methods you took to complete a previous project as well.

### Example Presentation Topics
Your presentation can be on anything we covered, or anything that is loosely related to the topics of journalism or design. Here are some examples of presentation topics that students might use:

* Tutorials
  * How to use the ____ Tool in Illustrator or Photoshop
  * How to make a ____ in Illustrator
  * How to create ____ in Tableau
* Tools, tips and tricks
  * Useful preferences in Illustrator/Photoshop
  * Useful book or website for design
  * Useful application for Mac/PC
* Concepts
  * What is responsive design?
  * What is modular design?
  * How to choose fonts correctly
  * History of infographics

 
## Submission
You may present on any day before classes end (**Dec 10, 2016**). You should let me know which day you want to present beforehand - either in person, through the Google Drive sign-up sheet, or through e-mail. You don't need to submit anything on Canvas.
