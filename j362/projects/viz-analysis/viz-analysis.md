# j360 - Visualization Analysis Exercise
## Description
This is a class exercise in which groups will `analyze`, `deconstruct`, and `critique` data visualizations. This in-class exercise isn't graded; it's to prepare for Project 3 - a written assignment with similar principles.

## Groups
Groups will be assigned randomly, by selection of a playing card. Each group will have a visualization story provided to them:

* `Aces` - [Information is Beautiful - Gender Pay Gap in the US](http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/gender-pay-gap-us/)
* `2s` - [Tampa Bay Times - Failure Factories](http://www.tampabay.com/projects/2015/investigations/pinellas-failure-factories/chart-failing-black-students/)
* `3s` - [New York Times - What China Has Been Building in the South China Sea](http://nyti.ms/1KDinEr)
* `4s` - [New York Times - 1.5 Million Missing Black Men](http://nyti.ms/1P5Gpa7)

## Process
`Individual` -> `Group` -> `Class`

### Individual - Reading <small>(10-15 min)</small>
First, each group member will read the story as individuals. Because people process information differently, it is important that each member takes time to read and analyze the story individually; this will provide more valuable contributions to the group's effort.

### Group - Analysis and Discussion <small>(20 min)</small>
Groups will discuss topics (provided below), encouraged to find areas where individuals agree and disagree. **There are no wrong answers.** Good data viz stories are designed to make stories accessible to **as many people possible**, and you are all readers with valid opinions, perspectives, and viewpoints.

#### Questions and Topics
1. Summarize this story in one to two sentences.
2. Attempt to answer the five W's:
	* Who?
	* What?
	* Where?
	* When?
	* Why?
3. What kind of visualizations did this story use? For example - bar charts, bubble charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.  
4. Did you find that the types of visualizations used (e.g., maps/line charts) were appropriate for this story?  
5. How did the visualizations contribute to the story? What information was made clearer by use of graphics?  
6. What could have been done better? Were there any charts/visualizations that did not make sense?
7. Would you change anything in the way that information is presented in this story? If so, what would you change?
8. Try to envision this story being published about 30 years ago. How much different would it be? Could traditional print journalism accomplish what this story does with its graphics?

### Class - Sharing <small>(5min per group)</small>
After group discussions, each group will share briefly about their experience with the story, presenting their findings and opinions to the class as a whole. The instructor and other class members will participate in the discussion, contributing ideas and observations.
