# j362 - Project 3: Tableau Visualization

## Description
For project three, you will create a Tableau-based visualization that you will publish to the web using Tableau Public. The objective of this assignment is to get hands-on experience with Tableau, get familiar with data visualization, and create a useful portfolio piece. You will explore benefits and downsides of different types of visualizations, and create a compelling story using data-driven graphics to support your narrative.

#### Data Source
You will use the sample data `Sample - Superstore` which is included in every version of Tableau. You can find it here:

## Saving and Loading Files
Make sure you know how to save and load your files to/from Tableau Public. We will do the exercise in class, but here's a reminder:

`To Open:` File > Open from Tableau Public...  
`To Save:` File > Save to Tableau Public

For this, you must make sure that you ALWAYS have access to your Tableau Public account. Make sure that you have can sign in, and that you have access to the e-mail that you used to register, otherwise you might lose your progress.

Loss of data/access to Tableau Public is not an excuse for missing a deadline
