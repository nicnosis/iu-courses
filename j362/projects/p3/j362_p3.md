# j362 Project 3 - Visualization Analysis
## Description
Project 3 is very similar to the in-class group exercise we did; you will read and analyze a visualization article. The only difference is that you will do it individually instead of in a group this time.

The goal of this exercise is to incite meaningful thinking about the role that visualization and graphics can play in journalism. You will look at a given article and see it through different "lenses" - as a reader; as an aspiring journalist; as a designer. Remember that  **there are no wrong answers.** Good data viz stories are designed to make stories accessible to _as many people possible_, and you are all readers with valid opinions, perspectives, and viewpoints.

Your assignment should not exceed `500 words` in length.

## Process
1. Begin by choosing an article (see section `Articles` below) - pick one that you would like to read and analyze. If you would like to analyze a different article, that's fine - just include the link somewhere in your submission
2. Download the `Starter file` I give you. It is a Word document
3. Answer the provided questions, saving them in the starter file
4. Rename your document in this format - `j362_lastname-firstname.docx`
5. Upload your file to Canvas. You can either submit as a `.docx` (Word document) or `.pdf`

## Articles
Pick one of these articles or select your own:

1. Washington Post - [Presidential Candidates' Wikipedia Pages](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/presidential-wikipedias/)
2. Washington Post - [Raising Barriers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/world/border-barriers/global-illegal-immigration-prevention/)
