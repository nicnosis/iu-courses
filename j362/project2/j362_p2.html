<h1 id="toc_0">j362 - Project 2</h1>

<hr>

<h2 id="toc_1">Description</h2>

<p>You will create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych">triptych</a> that depicts the past, present, and future of your life. You will use three 1000x1000 pixel artboards in Illustrator - one each for <code>past, present, and future</code>.</p>

<p>Each panel must have at least <code>three visual elements</code>. A visual element could be a photo, text, color scheme.</p>

<p>Feel free to utilize typography, imagery, drawing, color, diagrams, or anything that you feel captures your persona at that time period. Use the W&#39;s - <code>Who, what, when, where, why, how</code> to generate ideas. Instead of focusing on your life as a whole, focus on key dramatic moments in each time period where something changed forever - for many people, this could be an accident, a discovery, a decision, or an event.</p>

<p>Some recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Places and scenery</code> - This could be specific (e.g., Chicago), or more general scenery (e.g., a corn field somewhere)</li>
<li><code>Plants and animals</code> - Perhaps there is a tree on campus you&#39;re fond of, a pet that you love, etc.</li>
<li><code>Experiences and events</code> - Maybe you plan to travel to Bangladesh in the future and want to depict that in your future panel. Perhaps you broke a bone in 2nd grade and needed a cast. Any significant event or memory will serve as good material for your narrative.</li>
<li><code>Listen to music</code> or <code>watch movies</code> from the past while you generate ideas; try to reconstruct how you felt at the time.</li>
<li><code>Create</code> a Pinterest board for this project - start pinning anything that resonates with you and can serve as potential inspiration for your project.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="toc_2">Questions to ask yourself</h4>

<p><code>PAST</code></p>

<ul>
<li>What is your fondest memory? Who was there, what happened, and why is it significant?</li>
<li>What is the single most impactful thing that happened to you growing up?</li>
<li>Did you have a favorite toy/game/movie/show growing up? Maybe you spent a lot of time building with Legos or playing Yahtzee with family.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>PRESENT</code></p>

<ul>
<li>What is your routine like? Think of school, work, and the habits in your life in general.</li>
<li>What are your favorite places/venues?</li>
<li>What are the most exciting parts of your life now?</li>
<li>What are the hardships in your life now?</li>
</ul>

<p><code>FUTURE</code></p>

<ul>
<li>What do you want to do?</li>
<li>What places do you want to go?</li>
<li>What challenges do you envision in the future? </li>
<li>What goals and aspirations do you have? Perhaps you want to go skydiving or learn kickboxing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_3">Examples</h3>

<p>In order to provide a better sense of direction, I&#39;ve included some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Example One - <a href="triptych/index.html">Interactive</a></li>
<li>Example Two - <a href="tg/1.jpg">Panel 1</a> | <a href="tg/2.jpg">Panel 2</a> | <a href="tg/3.jpg">Panel 3</a> | <a href="tg/full.png">All Panels</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4">Schedule</h2>

<p>Maintaining a steady work pace is integral to success. While you are free to tackle this project however you like, I recommend setting and pursuing goals to manage the development of your project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have your idea/concept ready by 10/3 (Monday)</li>
<li>Have Panel 1 finished by 10/5</li>
<li>Have Panel 2 finished by 10/10</li>
<li>Finish Panel 3 and refine your project with the remaining time</li>
</ul>

<p>Project 2 is due <code>Friday October 14th</code> by 11:59pm.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Grading</h2>

<p>10% of your grade will come from ideation and conceptualization - in other words, how well you brainstormed and planned your idea. For a project that aims to tell a visual story, spending ample time to envision and conceptualize your project beforehand will make the process much easier.</p>

<p>The rest of the grade is comprised of 30 points per panel.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Component</th>
<th style="text-align: right">Points</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Ideation and Concept</td>
<td style="text-align: right">10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Panel 1</td>
<td style="text-align: right">30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Panel 2</td>
<td style="text-align: right">30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Panel 3</td>
<td style="text-align: right">30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: right"><strong>100</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>When grading each panel, I am looking at:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Composition</code> - How well did you use the space on your artboard? Is it cluttered, sparse, or unbalanced? Using a grid can be helpful in defining your space before you begin working.</li>
<li><code>Narrative and cohesion</code> - Does the art succeed in telling a story? While open to interpretation, your work should strive to convey some kind of story or narrative. Viewers should be able to sense some progression of narrative from past to future.</li>
<li><code>Technique</code> - How well have you applied your knowledge of Illustrator? It should be evident that you are becoming comfortable with Illustrator and have been refining your technical skills.</li>
<li><code>Use of Elements</code> - You will choose visual elements to place on your artboards. The choice and execution of these elements should be sensible. For example, you might have fond memories of a dog from your childhood. Using an image or vector drawing of a dog would make sense. Your elements should go together and have similar visual style.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit your project in the form of a <code>.ai</code> file, as well as a <code>PDF</code> export via Canvas.</p>
