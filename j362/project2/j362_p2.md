#j362 - Project 2
---------
## Description
You will create a [triptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych) that depicts the past, present, and future of your life. You will use three 1000x1000 pixel artboards in Illustrator - one each for past, present, and future.

Each panel must have at least **three visual elements**. A visual element could be a photo, text, color scheme

### Examples
In order to provide a better sense of direction, I've included some examples:

## Schedule
Maintaining a steady work pace is integral to success. While you are free to tackle this project however you like, I recommend setting and pursuing goals to manage the development of your project.

* Have your idea/concept ready by 10/3 (Monday)
* Have Panel 1 finished by 10/5
* Have Panel 2 finished by 10/10
* Finish Panel 3 and refine your project with the remaining time

Project 2 is due `Friday October 14th` by 11:59pm.

## Grading
10% of your grade will come from ideation and conceptualization - in other words, how well you brainstormed and planned your idea. For a project that aims to tell a visual story, spending ample time to envision and conceptualize your project beforehand will make the process much easier.

The rest of the grade is comprised of 30 points per panel.

|Component|Points |
| ---     |-----: | 
| Ideation and Concept | 10 |
| Panel 1 | 30    | 
| Panel 2 | 30    | 
| Panel 3 | 30    |
|**Total**|**100**|

When grading each panel, I am looking at:

* `Composition` - How well did you use the space on your artboard? Is it cluttered, sparse, or unbalanced? Using a grid can be helpful in defining your space before you begin working.
* `Narrative and cohesion` - Does the art succeed in telling a story? While open to interpretation, your work should strive to convey some kind of story or narrative. Viewers should be able to sense some progression of narrative from past to future.
* `Technique` - How well have you applied your knowledge of Illustrator? It should be evident that you are becoming comfortable with Illustrator and have been refining your technical skills.
* `Use of Elements` - You will choose visual elements to place on your artboards. The choice and execution of these elements should be sensible. For example, you might have fond memories of a dog from your childhood. Using an image or vector drawing of a dog would make sense. Your elements should go together and have similar visual style.
