Review this checklist to ensure you understand the concepts covered. You are encouraged to ask for clarification, review, or examples for anything that has been covered so far - I am happy to do in-class demonstrations.

### Artboards and Document Setup

Make sure that you know how to:

* Create, open and save files in Illustrator
* Create, move, and resize artboards
* Create artboards of a specified size (e.g. 1000x1000 pixels)

### Object Basics; Fill and Stroke

Make sure you know how to:

* Change fill and stroke color of an object
* Change stroke width of an object (e.g., make a thicker outline)
* Copy the appearance of another object with the Eyedropper tool - `I` key
* Create simple objects - rectangles and ellipses. Also ensure that you can create objects of specified dimensions (e.g., a 200x200 rectangle)

### Selections
Make sure you know how to:

* Select objects with the select tool - `V` key
* Select parts of an object with the direct select tool - `A` key
* Select objects of similar appearance with the Magic Wand tool
* Use the _`Select > Same`_ menu option to select objects with same fill/stroke/appearance
* Know how to move objects between layers
* Rearrange the order of objects with `cmd + [` and `cmd + ]`
* Group objects with `cmd + G`
* Add/remove objects to selection by holding `shift` and clicking

### Object Manipulation and Transformation
In general, the word **transform** refers to doing one of three things to an object:

* **Translating** (moving) an object; changing its x/y position
* **Scaling** (resizing) an object; changing its width/height/dimensions
* **Rotating** an object; changing its angle

Ensure you can:

* Move objects - either with the select tool or using the `Move` command from the menu
* Hold `shift` while moving an object to constrain it to 45 degree increments
* Hold `option` while moving an object to duplicate it
* Use `cmd + D` to repeat a transformation
* Use the free transform tool (`E` key) to scale and rotate objects
* Use the _`Object > Transform`_ menu option for more precise transformations
* Use the _`Object > Transform > Transform each`_ option to transform a selection of multiple objects at once

### View, Grids and Guides
Make sure you can:

* Use _`Object > Path > Split into grid`_ to create a grid from a rectangle
* Make guides, particularly by turning objects into guides with `cmd + 5`
* Use the _`View`_ menu to lock/unlock guides
* Show/hide guides with `cmd + '`
* Comfortably organize text and other visual elements along a grid
* Switch between outline and preview mode with `cmd + Y`

A couple of useful hotkeys for views:

* `cmd + 0` - fit artboard in window
* `cmd + 1` - actual size
* Hold `space` to bring up the hand tool while using another tool. This allows you to pan around the artboard
* Use `cmd + Plus` and `cmd + Minus` to zoom in and out
* Use `tab` to show and hide workspace panels
