# J362 MULTIMEDIA STORYTELLING - FALL 2016

**SECTION** - 31511  
**ROOM** - FF 062  
**TIME** - MW 2:30pm - 3:45pm
**INSTRUCTOR** - Nicolas Aguirre - naguirre@indiana.edu  
**OFFICE HOURS** - FF M130S (Stack 4), Friday 10:00-11:00a 

## Description
Web design has a profound impact on our everyday experiences of work, recreation, and communication. This course focuses on developing practical, marketable skills for front-end web development. Fundamentally, this course focuses on **experience** and **design** as they relate to web development; technical details and coding are secondary. The internet is constantly evolving - sometimes in a way that is seemingly unpredictable and erratic. Upon completion of this course, students will have a strong foundation of the technical and design skills necessary to produce pleasant web experiences, and the skills to adapt to a constantly-changing medium.

### Prerequisites

```
MSCH-C 226 or JOUR-J 210 with a grade of C- or
higher, or permission from instructor
Above class P - At least Sophomore standing
```

## Objectives
In this course, you will:

 * Learn principles of visual design, typography, and composition
 * Be exposed to design standards
 * Develop mastery of tools and applications for elegant media design
 * Gain familiarity with the creative prototyping process
 * Establish an effective workflow and digital work environment
 * Learn to give, receive, and utilize constructive criticism
 * Produce aesthetic and functional media products
 * Explore emerging trends in media
 * Build attractive portfolio pieces
 * Develop versatile means of communicating information visually

## Work
This class is project-driven, and demands consistent effort inside and outside of the classroom. Classes are intended to be variable and may feature lectures, tutorials, in-class exercises, discussions and lab time. Coverage of technical details such as code syntax is primarily handled outside of the classroom. Class time will generally be utilized to work on projects and review progress.

### Projects
You will be responsible for completing four projects, which will constitute 80% of your grade. Each project will require critical thinking and analysis as well as strong prototyping skills.

Three of these assignments will be assigned by the instructor, the final project can be chosen from a list of potential projects, or based off of individual or group interest in a particular facet of media.

I am willing to adapt projects to fit the professional interests of students - we may focus on journalism, animation, data manipulation, or any number of other topics. Because this course aims to provide tangible skillsets and viable portfolio pieces, the instructor aims to provide projects that will prove enticing or useful to those considering working in the industry.

#### Project 1
Typography - Pixel font

#### Project 2
Triptych

#### Project 3
Tableau

#### Project 4
Use JS

*Students can gain extra points by using a CSS precompiler such as SCSS/SASS or Stylus.*

#### Topics for Project 4
Project 4 will be chosen by the student. This course is relatively flexible with respect to creative boundaries, and students are welcome to propose their own projects. Many students will choose to build on existing sites, others may aim to focus on a specific facet of web development. I will attempt to cater to the interests and skillsets of the class as a whole. JavaScript libraries are likely to be used in some capacity.

Some potential topics:

 * C3, D3, Dimple or any other visualization library
 * ScrollMagic
 * P5.js, P5-game
 * Leaflet - Interactive Maps
 * VideoJS
 * PHP
 * WordPress
 * RemarkJS



### In-class Activities
Participation is an important element of this class. It is not enough to read about web design and its constituent languages; one must actively practice and hone their skills to be successful. Many of our classes will focus on the completion of certain exercises, tutorials, and discussions. 

### Final
There is no final exam for this class, the date of the final exam will be used to analyze and critique your fourth and final project.

## Grade

There are a total of **100** points in this class. The grade is divided as follows:

| Assignment    |     Points    |
| ------------- |--------------:| 
| Four projects (20 each)     | 80 | 
| Attendance and participation      | 10      | 
| One tutorial or presentation | 10      | 
| **Total** | **100** |

Your grade will be assigned as follows:

|Points|Grade|
| ---- | --- |
| 93 - 100 | A |
| 90 - 92 | A- |
| 87 - 89 | B+ |
| 84 - 86|B|
|80 - 83|B-|
|77 - 79|C+|
|74 - 76|C|
|70 - 73|C-|
|67 - 69|D+|
|60 - 66|D|
|59 and below|F|

Grading criteria will be given for each individual assignment.

## Analysis, Critiques, Revisions  
Following the completion of each project, students and the instructor will assess each individual submission. The intent is to spur meaningful discussion about design, and attract new ideas and opportunities for improvement. Because the creation of new media is an iterative process, students are allowed to revise and resubmit assignments. 



## Required Readings and Materials

TBA

### Software
Software is a focal point of this course, and an effort was made to ensure that free, cross-platform software will be used wherever possible. Tools, applications, and services prove invaluable in web development. A good deal of class time will be spent assisting students with installation and configuration of software.  

We will use:  

 1. A text editor - Webstorm is recommended. Good alternatives are SublimeText and TextWrangler.
 2. The Adobe Creative Suite - This is absolutely mandatory. Tutorials will cover Photoshop and Illustrator.
 3. A means of version control - Google Drive or DropBox is a free and useful way to do this. More tech-savy users may prefer GitHub
 4. A way to host your content - GitHub Pages is recommended. You can also purchase a domain and hosting services through a domain provider such as JustHost.  

### Hardware needs  
While web development can be done from any operating system, the instructor teaches workflow for OS X users. Access to a computer with Mac OS X is highly recommended. All students should have access to a Mac through the computer lab. Students who aren't using OS X will not benefit as much from lectures and tutorials. 

We will be using Illustrator and other programs that require use of the mouse very frequently. Consider getting a comfortable mouse - many OS X users like Apple's Magic Mouse. Few students will be comfortable working with the trackpad for long periods of time. Use of a stylus tablet (e.g., Wacom) is also welcome.

It is also useful to have access to a large display, or dual display configuration. 

## Policies

### Attendance
Students should make a serious effort to attend every lecture. A repeated pattern of absence or tardiness will result in a deduction of points from your participation grade.

### Food and Drink in Class
Sorry, they are not permitted.

### Deadlines
Deadlines are strict and non-negotiable. Late assignments will be accepted for the first five calendar days after a deadline. After that, I will remove 10% daily. Assignments may not be submitted after five calendar days have elapsed (Example - Deadline is September 8th, you cannot submit after September 13th)

### Proper Attribution for Referenced Works
By nature, code is re-usable and extensible. It is both acceptable and encouraged to utilize and adapt examples of code; this is common on websites like StackOverflow. However, the sources for all referenced code must be given in your code commenting. I will assist students with finding code that is reusable (such as under the GNU license), and help with giving proper credit to the source.

### Students with Disabilities
If any student requires assistance or academic accommodations for a disability, please contact me by after class, by e-mail, or during office hours. The student must have established eligibility for disability support services through the Office of Disability Services for Students.

### Religious Holidays 

*It is the policy of Indiana University that instructors must reasonably accommodate students who want to observe their religious holidays at times when academic requirements conflict with those observances. This policy is intended to ensure that both faculty and students are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in the accommodation of students' religious observances.*

### Syllabus
Our schedule will be followed more rigidly in the first half of the semester, and more loosely in the second half. Courses such as this one will have a wide array of students with varying strengths and weaknesses. Because this course is rich in content, I reserve the right to amend this syllabus to better match the needs of a given class. 


## Schedule
Schedule is subject to change. The last half of the semester is more variable as students will have their choice of projects.
