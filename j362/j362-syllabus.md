# J362 MULTIMEDIA STORYTELLING - FALL 2016

**SECTION** - 31511  
**ROOM** - FF 062  
**TIME** - MW 2:30pm - 3:45pm  
**INSTRUCTOR** - Nicolas Aguirre - naguirre@indiana.edu  
**OFFICE HOURS** - FF M130S (Stack 4), Friday 10:00am - 11:00am 

## Description

Multimedia Storytelling focuses on use of visual design for narrative purpose. In this course, students will produce visual and interactive media that have journalistic applications. This is a project-oriented course and aims to help students create useful portfolio pieces. Static imagery, data visualization, and web-design are the focal media of this course. The key applications used are Adobe Illustrator, Tableau Public, and a web development tool such as Webstorm or SublimeText.

### Prerequisites
```
MSCH-C 226 or JOUR-J 210 with a grade of C- or
higher, or permission from instructor
Above class P - At least Sophomore standing
```

## Objectives
In this course, you will:

 * Learn principles of visual design, typography, and composition
 * Be exposed to design standards
 * Develop mastery of tools and applications for elegant media design
 * Gain familiarity with the creative prototyping process
 * Establish an effective workflow and digital work environment
 * Learn to give, receive, and utilize constructive criticism
 * Produce aesthetic and functional media products
 * Build attractive portfolio pieces
 * Develop versatile means of communicating information visually

## Work
This class is project-driven, and demands consistent effort inside and outside of the classroom. Classes are intended to be variable and may feature lectures, tutorials, in-class exercises, discussions and lab time. Coverage of technical details such as code syntax is primarily handled outside of the classroom. Class time will generally be utilized to work on projects and review progress.

### Projects
You will be responsible for completing four projects, which will constitute 80% of your grade. Each project will require critical thinking and analysis as well as strong prototyping skills.

Three of these assignments will be assigned by the instructor, the final project can be chosen from a list of potential projects, or based off of individual or group interest in a particular facet of media.

I am willing to adapt projects to fit the professional interests of students - we may focus on journalism, animation, data manipulation, or any number of other topics. Because this course aims to provide tangible skillsets and viable portfolio pieces, the instructor aims to provide projects that will prove enticing or useful to those considering working in the industry.

#### Project 1 - Pen Tool, and Basic Visual Elements
Students will use **Illustrator** with primitive shapes (circles, squares, polygons) to produce a work of art. Focus is on mastery of the pen tool, object manipulation in Illustrator, and communicating a lot with few visual elements.

#### Project 2 - Visual Narrative - Triptych  
Students will use **Illustrator** produce a three-panel triptych depicting their past, present, and future with visual language.

#### Project 3 - Data-driven Narrative - Tableau
Students will use **Tableau Public** or another visualization tool to create a data-driven story.

#### Project 4 - Web Interactivity
Students will use **JavaScript** to create an interactive web experience. For example, a student might use **P5.js** to create an animated scene on an HTML5 canvas. Students may also take a previous project and enhance it or add interactivity (e.g., adding interactivity to your triptych.)

_**Proposal**_  
This course is relatively flexible with respect to creative boundaries, and students may pursue their own creative vision for Project 4. Many students will choose to build on existing projects, others may aim to focus on a specific facet of media. For Project 4, students must submit a conceptual prototype and written proposal that meets instructor approval.

### In-class Activities
Participation is an important element of this class. It is not enough to listen to lectures or read books; one must actively practice and hone their skills to be successful. Many of our classes will focus on the completion of certain exercises, tutorials, and discussions. 

### Final
There is no final exam for this class, the date of the final exam will be used to analyze and critique your fourth project, as well as show your progress throughout the semester.

## Grade

There are a total of **100** points in this class. The grade is divided as follows:

| Assignment    |     Points    |
| ------------- |--------------:| 
| Four projects (20 each)     | 80 | 
| Attendance and participation      | 10      | 
| One tutorial or presentation | 10      | 
| **Total** | **100** |

Your grade will be assigned as follows:

|Points|Grade|
| ---- | --- |
| 93 - 100 | A |
|90 - 92 | A- |
|87 - 89 | B+ |
|84 - 86|B|
|80 - 83|B-|
|77 - 79|C+|
|74 - 76|C|
|70 - 73|C-|
|67 - 69|D+|
|60 - 66|D|
|59 and below|F|

Grading criteria will be given for each individual assignment.

## Analysis, Critiques, Revisions  
Following the completion of each project, students and the instructor will assess each individual submission. The intent is to spur meaningful discussion about design, and attract new ideas and opportunities for improvement. Because the creation of new media is an iterative process, students are allowed to revise and resubmit assignments. 


## Required Readings and Materials

There are no required course texts, but one is recommended:  

*Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach through Design* (2nd Edition) by William Lidwell

### Software
Software is a focal point of this course, and an effort was made to ensure that free, cross-platform software will be used wherever possible. Tools, applications, and services prove invaluable in web development. A good deal of class time will be spent assisting students with installation and configuration of software.  

We will use:  

 1. The Adobe Creative Suite - We will be using Adobe Illustrator to conceptualize and design our visual storytelling components.
 2. File storage - Google Drive or DropBox is a free and useful way to do this. More tech-savy users may prefer GitHub
 3. Web hosting - IU Pages or GitHub Pages are good choices. You can also purchase a domain and hosting services through a domain provider such as JustHost.  
 4. Tableau Public - Data visualization can be daunting, but Tableau provides a relatively intuitive means of converting raw data into meaningful visualizations.

### Hardware needs  
While web development can be done from any operating system, the instructor teaches workflow for OS X users. Access to a computer with Mac OS X is highly recommended. All students should have access to a Mac through the computer lab. Students who aren't using OS X will not benefit as much from lectures and tutorials. 

We will be using Illustrator and other programs that require use of the mouse very frequently. Consider getting a comfortable mouse - many OS X users like Apple's Magic Mouse. Few students will be comfortable working with the trackpad for long periods of time. Use of a stylus tablet (e.g., Wacom) is also welcome.

It is also useful to have access to a large display, or dual display configuration. 

## Policies

### Attendance
Students should make a serious effort to attend every lecture. A repeated pattern of absence or tardiness will result in a deduction of points from your participation grade.

### Food and Drink in Class
Sorry, they are not permitted.

### Deadlines
Deadlines are strict and non-negotiable. Late assignments will be accepted for the first five calendar days after a deadline. After that, I will remove 10% daily. Assignments may not be submitted after five calendar days have elapsed (Example - Deadline is September 8th, you cannot submit after September 13th)

### Proper Attribution for Referenced Works
By nature, code is re-usable and extensible. It is both acceptable and encouraged to utilize and adapt examples of code; this is common on websites like StackOverflow. However, the sources for all referenced code must be given in your code commenting. I will assist students with finding code that is reusable (such as under the GNU license), and help with giving proper credit to the source.

Any datasets used for visualization must also be referenced.

### Students with Disabilities
If any student requires assistance or academic accommodations for a disability, please contact me by after class, by e-mail, or during office hours. The student must have established eligibility for disability support services through the Office of Disability Services for Students.

### Religious Holidays 

*It is the policy of Indiana University that instructors must reasonably accommodate students who want to observe their religious holidays at times when academic requirements conflict with those observances. This policy is intended to ensure that both faculty and students are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in the accommodation of students' religious observances.*

### Syllabus
Our schedule will be followed more rigidly in the first half of the semester, and more loosely in the second half. Courses such as this one will have a wide array of students with varying strengths and weaknesses. Because this course is rich in content, I reserve the right to amend this syllabus to better match the needs of a given class. 


## Schedule
Schedule is subject to change. The last half of the semester is more variable as students will have their choice of projects.
