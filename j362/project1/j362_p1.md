#j362 - Project 1
---------

For Project 1, you will design an album cover in Illustrator.  
This assignment is designed to be enjoyed as a `creative and exploratory endeavor`, rather than a task with stringent constraints.


You will use this project to apply your knowledge of:

* Grids and composition
* Type, font, and text
* Color scheming


### Requirements
Use [this file](p1_starter.ai) to start with. You'll be making five artboards:

1. One artboard that contains `five color palettes`
2. Three **grid layouts** (each on a separate artboard.) You will use the **split into grid** command in Illustrator, along with the **turn into guide** (CMD+5) command to create structural grids for typographic components. Use [lorem ipsum](http://lipsum.com/) as your sample text. Have `at least one sans serif and one serif` font. Experiment with different font weights and styles (e.g. bold, italic, light, dark).
