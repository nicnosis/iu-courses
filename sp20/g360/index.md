## Week 12
Last week you set a milestone goal for your project. You will present progress this week.

You will either:
 * (a) present on the Zoom call, and I will assign your grade or
 * (b) Make a Loom video showing your project and explaining. Please keep the video under two minutes. E-mail me the Loom link with subject line '[G360] Week 12 Participation'

### For Next Week
You will only attend one of the Zoom sessions.

You will schedule a timeslot on [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cyhA-tvNMq2xpWguossFdMR19uBHzOYPC_ngdfFfoNw/edit?usp=sharing) with me.

Because I have limited 'class time' to do this; if you are able to pick a time outside class hours then please do so. This allows me to better serve students during our class time.

You will use the other day to work on your project.
