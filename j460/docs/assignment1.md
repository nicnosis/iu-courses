## Connect and Upload

#### Get an FTP client
You will need a program, called an FTP client, that establishes a connection with your site, allowing you to upload files.

OSX users - Download [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)  
PC Users - Download [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) or [Putty](http://www.putty.org/)

#### Get an FTP Account
You will need a username and password that you use with your FTP client to connect to your site. This is basically a set of credentials that allows you to move files onto the web server that hosts your site.

If you are using IU Pages - your IU username will be your login, and you should be issued a password that you can use.

#### Connect
OSX Users, see [this article](https://kb.iu.edu/d/akom) on using Cyberduck.  
PC Users, see [this article](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bfoc) on using WinSCP.

#### Upload
To put your site on your page, there's a public directory (folder) usually called `www` or `public_html`. This is your "root directory" for your site. Drag and drop your entire project folder in the root directory of your site, or into the `j460` folder on your site.

## Submission
Homework 1 is due __Friday, February 2/24__

You will submit on Canvas. All you need to do is link to your website, where the `index.html` file is located. Your submission link might look something like this: `mywebsite.com/j460/index.html`
