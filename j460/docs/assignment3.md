# Assignment 3 + elective
## Description
I have chosen to __combine__ the `elective assignment` with assignment 3. This way, we will be able to take our time and you can produce a quality portfolio piece without feeling rushed or anxious.

For assignment 3, you will find and prepare your own data, make a visualization, and add a short write-up about the experience. The purpose of this assignment is to make a compelling and attractive portfolio piece and give you some independence as an aspiring data viz practitioner.

__Don't freak out!__ I will be helping you every step of the way. Since this assignment is more free-form and open-ended, I will use more class time to work with individuals. You are expected to come up with the idea and find some data, but I am more than willing to help you along the way.

Important to note is that you **do not necessarily have to use d3.js** for this assignment. You may find it helpful to use other tools that are less programming-intensive such as Excel, [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students), [Sci2](https://sci2.cns.iu.edu/user/index.php), and [gephi](https://gephi.org/).

The main steps to this assignment are:

1. Find your data
2. Choose an appropriate visualization (e.g., bar chart, scatterplot, map)
3. Submit your idea - This helps me to find links, tools, and resources that help you
4. Work on your assignment
5. Create a write-up/analysis for this project that details your process and experience

## Part 1 - Finding data
#### Getting the Right Data
 * __What you want__ - CSV, TSV, and JSON files that you can just load in and start visualizing
 * __What you don't want__ - Messy, poorly formatted data; PDF files; HTML tables; anything where you have to do significant work in copying/pasting/rearranging data
 * __A useful strategy__ is to look at example visualizations, perhaps on [b.locks](https://bl.ocks.org/) and take a look at the type of data they used. E.g., if you find a bar chart example where the dataset looks similar to the data you have, then a bar chart might be a good choice.

#### Where to Find Data
I have added a `datasets` section to the site. Check the link below.

Make sure that you __take your time__ finding data; if you are thorough and methodical in your selection of data it will actually make the project a lot easier and less time-consuming.

## Part 2 - Choosing a visualization
At this point, you want to have some idea of how you will bring your data into a visualization. You might say something like, "I want to visualize world population with a choropleth map," or, "I want to show infant mortality rates over time with a line chart." Once you have a concrete idea like this, it's just a matter of finding some starter code and fitting your data into it.

[This article](https://eazybi.com/blog/data_visualization_and_chart_types/) is a great starting point.

Some questions to think about:

 * Are you showing change over time? A line chart (such as the stock market example we did) might be a good fit
 * Are you comparing parts of a whole?
 * Is location important? You might consider using a map

#### Tools
You may use any number of tools, including d3.js.

A good way to generate quick prototypes is to use [RAWGraphs](http://rawgraphs.io/) - this will give you an idea of what kind of visualizations will/won't work for your dataset. You can also check out [d3 builder](https://my.infocaptor.com/free_data_visualization.php) - this allows you to upload a CSV and work in the browser.

Here are some viz tools you might consider:

 * [dimple](http://dimplejs.org/)
 * [c3](http://c3js.org/) - Make sure you are using __d3.v3__. Version 4 won't work
 * [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/demo)
 * [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students)



## Part 3 - Submit your idea
Use thisformthisformthisform

Remember that the more information you have, the more I can help. I am happy to find examples and links that may assist you in your endeavors. If you submit your idea very late in the semester, or you haven't given much thought to it, I will be less inclined to help.

## Part 4 - Work
The sooner you get a dataset and idea, the better. You are expected to make progress on a regular basis. I will be doing less lecturing, and more helping individuals in class. This means that if you don't come to class prepared, with your progress on this assignment, I won't be able to help.

## Part 5 - Write-up
This part exists to show people your process and experience in creating a visualization. Spending some time on the write-up will differentiate you from other students. A good write-up conveys to employers that:

1. You are methodical and detail-oriented in your work
2. You care about the process of your work and not just the outcome
3. You have a skillset that can produce the same quality of work
