# Extra Credit
You have one opportunity to earn __two extra credit points__. There are two ways to do this:

1. Participate in an [ICR](http://www.indiana.edu/~icr/home.php) study
2. Create a working code example with a jQuery plugin

## ICR Study
Yanqin Lu, a PhD student at IU, is conducting research for his dissertation. His message is:

Hello!  
My name is Yanqin Lu and I am currently a doctoral candidate in the Media School. I am looking for volunteers to participate in an experiment about Facebook use.  
This study has two parts. The first involves filling out an online survey after you sign up for this study. It will last approximately 10 minutes.  
The second part of the study takes place at the Institute for Communication Research (ICR). You will be seated in a comfortable chair in the study room facing a computer monitor with built-in eye-tracking affixed to the bottom of the monitor. The experimenter will explain the procedure for eye-tracking calibration. First, you will watch a red dot as it moves around the screen so that the eye-tracker can detect and calibrate your pupils correctly. The dots are presented successively and you must focus your visual attention on the center of the dots. You will then be asked to browse several Facebook pages and answer a series of questions. If you feel disturbed by the questions, you may choose to end your participation in the study without penalty. The second part of the study will last approximately 20 minutes.  
To participate in this study, you can sign up online using this URL <http://tiny.cc/xvagjy>. Please complete the first part of this study (survey link: <https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_blxvtLrQGd9ORs9>) BEFORE coming to the ICR for the second part. You will receive a reminder of your appointment 24 hours in advance with more specific instructions on how to get to the ICR in Franklin Hall. If youâ€™ve signed up for this study in a previous class, you may not sign up a second time.  
If you have any questions about this study, please feel free to contact me at luyan@indiana.edu

Thank you very much!

Yanqin Lu

## jQuery Plugin
If you don't want to participate in the ICR study, you can create a simple web page using a jQuery plugin. You can use any, but the two that I recommend are:

 * [Spectrum JS](https://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/)
 * [TwentyTwenty](http://zurb.com/playground/twentytwenty)

## Submission
If you are doing the ICR study, then I will receive proof of your participation towards the end of the semester. If you are doing the jQuery plugin, you must upload it to your page and send me a link through Canvas.

You will not see the extra credit listed on Canvas; I will add it at the very end to your final grade.
