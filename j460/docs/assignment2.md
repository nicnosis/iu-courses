# Assignment 2
## Description
We will be using earthquake data from [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php) to create a bubble map. The goal is to combine d3 and Leaflet to mag global earthquakes by magnitude.

Malcom McLean, better known as [d3noob](https://leanpub.com/u/d3noob) has an excellent [tutorial](http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/9267535) that combines d3 and leaflet. This is a great opportunity to showcase how you can build off of somebody else's code to create your own visualization. If you choose to use this project in your portfolio, make sure you link to the tutorial source code and credit him in some way.

## Demo
This project features a [live demo](../demo/assignment2/). The purpose of this demo is to give you an idea of what your map should look like when it's finished. Yours doesn't have to be perfectly identical, but it should look quite similar. You may choose to adjust things such as color and size of the bubbles based on your preference.

## Preparation
 * Go to [d3noob's gist](https://gist.github.com/d3noob/9267535) on github and click __"Download Zip"__.
 * Download [this dataset](../demo/assignment2/eq.json). It originates from USGS, but I have removed unnecessary columns and converted the format from `csv` to `json` for ease of use.
 * You will also need to login to [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/) to get your access token.

## Tutorials
The best way to complete this project is to follow the video tutorials:

 * [Part 1 - Setup](https://youtu.be/uvdQLro9kFQ)
 * [Part 2 - Configure rScale]()
 * [Part 3 - Adjust log scale]()

## Submission
Assignment 2 is due **Sunday February 26th** at 11:59pm.

You will submit on Canvas. All you need to do is link to your website, where the `index.html` file is located. Your submission link might look something like this: `mywebsite.com/j460/earthquakes/`
