If you cannot attend the timeslot for whatever reason, please let me know as soon as possible.

## week 13
__REMEMBER__ for this week you are attending only one of the two Zoom sessions. Even if your timeslot is not until further in the period, please attend the full session so that you can see others' work; this will give you excellent ideas and help you to avoid many pitfalls.

### __Announcement__
In the Fall I am teaching [G-438: Procedural Media](procedural-flyer.pdf).

Some highlights:
 * Learn programming in a fun and visually intuitive way
 * No pre-requisites— all skill levels welcome. You do not need to be an artist.
 * Build mastery of your tools and process in this production-heavy course
 * Make unique portfolio pieces with a niche skillset
 * Procedural assets for games— materials, shaders, environments

If you are interested, I advise you to register ASAP because it's a small class and seats are filling quickly.

### This Week
Our remaining time together will focus on using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), a JavaScript Library, to create interactive media for the web.

Structure for this week:

 * I will give you recorded lectures. I will explain your `participation` for the week in these lectures.
 * We will not meet for class.
 * I will still make myself available online. I will create ONE Zoom call for both sections; it will last from 9:30AM to 11:30AM. I will be available to answer questions about anything. I will send you the Zoom link through Canvas message.

#### Monday
 * `watch` [Hello p5](https://hello.p5js.org/)

Each exercise has a LECTURE and a PEN. __Make sure you use both.__

They are short, straightforward, and completing them will __make your Project Four 1000x EASIER__.

[THIS LINK](https://loom.com/share/folder/b89adeb76a3e4348b2f34efc4c8199a3) has the Loom shared folder with all the lectures in case you wanna bookmark it.

`complete` exercises:

   * The [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) section, which shows you how to do anything.
   * The [examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) section which will give you a lot of ideas on how to apply the code for creative projects. _(You can use this code in your projects! Just site it)_

You will come up with your [Project Four](assignments/p4.html) idea.

## Week 15
 * `complete` your [Course Questionnaire](https://coursequestionnaire.iu.edu/) for this course.

This week I'll review everyone's project progress and give feedback on how to address technical and creative problems. Whether you have a lot or a little to present, you will benefit from this exercise.

I will send out Zoom links. We will meet during normal hours.
