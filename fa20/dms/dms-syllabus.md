## Premise
__The game has changed.__

The digital media landscape is brutally COMPETITIVE.

Traffic has become harder and harder to obtain, and your audience's attention span is shorter than ever. There has never been a greater demand for high-quality, engaging content.

The availability of cheap, global labor has made it harder than ever to compete.

You will not survive by being average. Your brand and your content needs to be EXTRAORDINARY and UNFORGETTABLE.

Many brands, businesses, and creators FAIL. Why?
 * Inability to hold the attention of their audience, or even get traffic in the first place.
 * A lack of quality content
 * No sense of identity or values

Fortunately, we now have a solid understanding of why people engage with certain content, why they attach to certain brands, and what makes them buy.

In __Digital Media Strategy__, you will learn how to navigate the digital landscape and make yourself known with an unforgettable identity and extraordinary content.

## Objectives
Upon completion of this course, you will be able to:

_Brand Identity Design:_
 * Start With WHY: Seed your brand in a bold and compelling mission statement.
 * Visual Identity: Create a memorable and consistent appearance.
 * Positioning: Stand out from the herd with an unforgettable digital presence.
 * Community Building: Engage your audience and create a cult-like following.

_Content:_
 * Social Media Strategy: Understand today’s social media platforms and how to most effectively navigate them.
 * Content Strategy: Discover trends and assess audience demand to create content that consumers actually want.
 * Optimization: Make sure the algorithm promotes your content rather than hiding it.

_Marketing:_
 * Create Offers: Serve your audience with a killer product catalog.
 * Monetize Content: Turn your best creative ideas into products.
 * Targeting: Defining your ideal client avatar.
 * Cold Outreach: Create authentic connections with your ideal client.

### ACEJMC Professional values and competencies
The ACEJMC, the accrediting council that periodically reviews our undergraduate degree program, has created a set of professional values and competencies that the faculty here subscribes to. We think all journalism graduates should be aware of certain core concepts. Below are the ones we will focus most on in this class.

 * Demonstrate an understanding of the diversity of peoples and cultures and of the significance and impact of mass communications in a global society;
 * Understand concepts and apply theories in the use and presentation of images and information;
 * Think critically, creatively and independently;

## Structure


## Work
### Use of Class Time
This class is project-driven, and demands consistent effort inside and outside of the classroom. Classes are intended to be variable and may feature lectures, tutorials, in-class exercises, discussions and lab time. An effort is made to create a more interactive and less passive experience for students.

### Projects (55 pts.)


### Homework (20 pts.)

### Professionalism (5 pts.)
Students are expected to behave like adults. Unprofessional behavior will be met with a grade deduction in this category.

Unprofessional behavior includes (but is not limited to):

 * Arriving to class late
 * Leaving class early
 * Failure to observe course policies
 * Disrespect towards classmates or instructor
 * Lack of consideration for classmates or instructor
 * Behavior that distracts classmates or instructor
 * Failure to practice academic integrity
 * Excessive use of cell phone during class

Grading criteria will be given for each individual assignment.

## Revisions
When software is created in a professional environment, changes and revisions are common. Factoring that web development is an iterative process, students are __sometimes__ allowed to revise and resubmit assignments. Re-submitting work is a __privilege__ granted at the instructor's discretion.

If you are re-submitting work:

1. You must have submitted the work by its due date. Late work is not eligible for re-submission.
2. The privilege to revise submitted work is only available for students who submitted substantial work; incomplete or dysfunctional code is not eligible for resubmission. This is at the instructor's discretion.
3. You may only recover partial points lost.

## Policies
### Attendance
Students should make a serious effort to attend every lecture. While attendance is not taken, I believe **attendance is the strongest guarantor of success** in this course.

Course material is cumulative in nature and class periods are used to develop programming skills and work on projects. You will also miss out on quizzes and participation activities if you miss class.

Students are expected to come on time and stay for the duration of the class period. __A repeated pattern of tardiness is not tolerated.__

### Deadlines
Deadlines are strict and non-negotiable. Late assignments will be accepted for the first three calendar days after a deadline. I will remove 15% for each day past the deadline _(Example--- If you got 85 on an assignment but submitted it two days late, you're getting a 55)_.

Assignments may not be submitted after three calendar days have elapsed (Example--- Deadline is September 8th, you cannot submit after September 11th)

The only __exception to this rule__ is the final project, which cannot be submitted late.

### Absences
Whether or not an absence is excused is __entirely at the discretion of the instructor__.

If you miss a quiz or participation exercise and have an __excused absence__, you have __one week__ to make up that assignment at office hours. If you cannot attend scheduled office hours, it is your responsibility to reach out and schedule another meeting time.

If you know you are going to be absent or late on a certain day, please tell me ahead of time.

### Lost Data
You are responsible for keeping backups/duplicates of your files. As an IU student, you should have access to a Box account. You can also use Google Drive or GitHub to maintain copies of your files. Losing your files is not an excuse for late or incomplete work.

I **highly recommend** getting a [Box](https://uits.iu.edu/box) account. It is free, helps you to stay organized, and most importantly provides **backups** for your files.

### Email
If you e-mail me, make sure you tell me:

 * Who you are
 * What class you're in

### Online Class Conduct
For our Zoom lectures, please behave the same way you would in a physical class setting.

Do:
 * Have your camera on
 * Be mentally present
 * Dedicate 100% of your attention to the task at hand

Don't:
 * Smoke or vape on camera
 * Multitask or do other things
 * Sit their idle like a useless turd
 * Fall asleep or sit there with your eyes closed
 * Do anything that's distracting to me or your classmates

Failure to meet these expectations can result in:
 * Being removed from the Zoom call
 * A deduction in participation/professionalism grades

### Self-care
Make an effort to take care of yourself. I value you deeply as a student and you should make an effort to take care of your mental well-being.

Meditation is an efficient and effective way to manage stress, improve cognitive performance, and overall health. You can get the [Headspace Student Plan](https://www.headspace.com/studentplan) for $9.99/yr.

IU provides [Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](https://healthcenter.indiana.edu/counseling/index.html). This center is staffed with specialists who work tirelessly to help struggling students with a variety of student life problems.

### Students with Disabilities
If any student requires assistance or academic accommodations for a disability, please contact me by after class, by e-mail, or during office hours. The student must have established eligibility for disability support services through the Office of Disability Services for Students.

For more information--- [https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/disability-services-students/](https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/disability-services-students/)

### Academic Integrity
As a student at IU, you are expected to adhere to the standards and policies detailed in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct (Code). When you submit an assignment with your name on it, you are signifying that the work contained therein is yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. All suspected violations of the Code will be reported to the Dean of Students and handled according to University policies. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment, reduction in your final course grade, and a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities. If you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or exam, be sure to seek clarification beforehand.

#### Proper Attribution for Referenced Works
By nature, code is re-usable and extensible. It is both acceptable and encouraged to utilize and adapt examples of code; this is common on websites like StackOverflow. However, the sources for all referenced code must be given in your code commenting. I will assist students with finding code that is reusable (such as under the GNU license), and help with giving proper credit to the source.

### Sexual Misconduct
As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to create a positive learning environment for all students. Title IX and IU’s Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibit sexual misconduct in any form, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and domestic violence.  If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone who has, the University can help.
If you are seeking help and would like to speak to someone confidentially, you can make an appointment with:

 * The Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS) at (812) 855-8900 (counseling services)
 * Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at (812) 856-2469 (advocacy and advice services)
 * IU Health Center at (812) 855-4011 (health and medical services)

It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct, with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU’s Title IX Coordinator.  In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available.   Protecting student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist.
I encourage you to visit stopsexualviolence.iu.edu to learn more.


### Religious Holidays

*It is the policy of Indiana University that instructors must reasonably accommodate students who want to observe their religious holidays at times when academic requirements conflict with those observances. This policy is intended to ensure that both faculty and students are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in the accommodation of students' religious observances.*
