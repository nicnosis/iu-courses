# Project Two - <small>Triptych</small>
## Description
You will use Illustrator to make a [triptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych), or a three-panel artwork.

Now that your technical skills in Illustrator are more refined, you will tell a story or convey an idea using a composition.

## Approach
### Ideation
Before you do any work at all, you need an idea. I recommend viewing examples of triptychs.

The three panel format is very powerful for storytelling purposes. You can convey ideas by breaking them into three parts.

One way is to use different thematic parts:
1. Morning, afternoon, night
2. Past, present, future
3. Birth, life, death
4. Negative, neutral, positive

Or you can use three different subjects _(e.g., three different birds, three different trees, etc.)_

#### Examples
I am a fan of using the three panels to represent _past-present-future_:

Here's [an example](../img/tg.png) that a colleague did.

### Finding inspiration
Before beginning, get ideas.

1. [Google Images](https://www.google.com/search?q=triptych+artwork&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj8eWYpbrXAhUrxYMKHVdnBScQ_AUICygC&biw=1536&bih=783)
2. [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=triptych)
3. [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/search/triptych)
4. [Behance](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&user_tags=973925)
5. [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/search?q=triptych)

### Getting Started
Once you have an idea, decide on the layout you want. I recommend creating three artboards in Illustrator. They do not have to be the same size, or positioned in a specific way. These are all possible layouts:

<img src="../img/trip-layouts.png" alt="">

If you can't decide, just create three artboards each sized `600x800` pixels.

### Iteration
You are expected to work on this regularly. The more often I see your work, the more I can guide you in the right direction.

## Requirements and Grading
This project is worth __fifteen points__.

 * `3 pts` ORGANIZATION:
   * See the submission details below.
   * Zip file must be named correctly.
   * Folder inside of your zip file must be named correctly.
   * Artboards must be named 1, 2, and 3.
   * There should be three exported images in `.png` file named in a sequential order
   * Groups should be used where appropriate. Objects/groups should be named.
   * Layers should be named properly.
   * Overall, your illustrator file should be orderly, sensible, and easy to navigate.

## Submission
`CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > PROJECT TWO`

I need your Illustrator file and the three images exported from it.

Name your artboards `1`, `2`, and `3`.

Use `File > Export as...` and export as a `.png`. Check `use artboards` to ensure you get three files. They should be named in sequential order (it must be obvious which is the first and which is the third)

You will be submitting `a single zip file`. The zip file should contain a folder named `p3-lastname-firstname` that has:

 1. Your `.ai` file named `triptych-lastname-firstname.ai`
 2. Exported PNGs of your files - THEY SHOULD BE IN NUMERICAL ORDER
