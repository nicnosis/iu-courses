# Homework Two - <small>Vector Art</small>
## Description
You will use Illustrator to create vector art.

I am open about what you want to do, but I'll make suggestions...

Your project will be:
1. _(geometrically)_ simple enough that it lends itself to vector art; do not use a subject that is photorealistic or overly detailed.
2. Scalable; you can reproduce it easily at different sizes
3. Aesthetically pleasing.

My recommendation is to create a vector art rendering of a [cartoon character](../img/fish.png) or something similar.


## Submission - Canvas
This time, you will submit an `.ai` file.

1. Your file must have one artboard in it. The artboard must be `1000px by 1000px`.
2. Your file must be named `hw2-lastname-firstname` _(e.g. hw2-aguirre-nicolas)_
3. Make sure your layers are named sensibly; avoid having layer 1, layer 2, copy of layer 2, copy of copy of layer 2 etc.
4. Make sure you have grouped objects sensibly.
