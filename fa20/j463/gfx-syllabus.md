## Description
Design is everywhere.

Design determines perception.

...and perception is **REALITY**.

We use design to:

 * Communicate
 * Persuade
 * Express
 * Inform
 * Inspire

At the end of this course:

 * You will master a powerful skillset that you can build upon later
 * You will craft stunning portfolio pieces that separate you from your competition
 * You will never see the world the same way again

## Objectives
By completing this course you will:

 * Understand and apply principles of graphic design— proportion, position, color, shape language, and more
 * Learn digital design tools (esp. Adobe)
 * Learn brand identity--- how a brand’s mission informs its visual aesthetic
 * Learn the ‘language’ of design; how to discuss and analyze design work
 * Discover and strengthen your creative faculties
 * Create several attractive portfolio pieces
 * Gain a foundation for expanding your design skills in any context

### ACEJMC Professional values and competencies
The ACEJMC, the accrediting council that periodically reviews our undergraduate degree program, has created a set of professional values and competencies that the faculty here subscribes to. We think all journalism graduates should be aware of certain core concepts. Below are the ones we will focus most on in this class.

 * Demonstrate an understanding of the diversity of peoples and cultures and of the significance and impact of mass communications in a global society;
 * Understand concepts and apply theories in the use and presentation of images and information;
 * Think critically, creatively and independently;

## Structure
This course is divided into __four units__, each about 3-4 weeks in length. Each unit will cover a different technology:

 * Unit One: Photoshop
 * Unit Two: Illustrator
 * Unit Three: Figma
 * Unit Four: Webflow

Each unit has one small assignment (homework) and one big assignment (project).

## Work
### Use of Class Time
This class is project-driven, and demands consistent effort inside and outside of the classroom. Classes are intended to be variable and may feature lectures, tutorials, in-class exercises, discussions and lab time. An effort is made to create a more interactive and less passive experience for students.

### Projects (55 pts.)
Each unit has one project. Projects are designed to be challenging, cumulative, and result in a splendid portfolio piece.

### Homework (20 pts.)
Each unit has one homework assignment. These are designed to test and reinforce knowledge from class.

### Participation (20 pts.)
Participation is an important element of this class. It is not enough to read about graphic design; one must actively practice and hone their skills to be successful.

Many of our classes will focus on the completion of certain exercises, tutorials, and discussions. Most class days will feature a small participation exercise.

__Some participation assignments are due during class, and some are due before class.__

### Professionalism (5 pts.)
Students are expected to behave like adults. Unprofessional behavior will be met with a grade deduction in this category.

Unprofessional behavior includes (but is not limited to):

 * Arriving to class late
 * Leaving class early
 * Failure to observe course policies
 * Disrespect towards classmates or instructor
 * Lack of consideration for classmates or instructor
 * Behavior that distracts classmates or instructor
 * Failure to practice academic integrity
 * Excessive use of cell phone during class

__Online Class Conduct__  
For our Zoom lectures, please behave the same way you would in a physical class setting.

Do:

 * Have your camera on
 * Be mentally present
 * Dedicate 100% of your attention to the task at hand

Don't:

 * Smoke or vape on camera
 * Multitask _(e.g. watching Netflix in another window)_
 * Fall asleep or sit there with your eyes closed
 * Sit there idle like a useless turd
 * Do anything that's distracting to me or your classmates

Failure to meet these expectations can result in:

 * Being removed from the Zoom call
 * A deduction in participation/professionalism grades

### Final
There is no final exam for this class. You will submit Project Four as your last assignment.

## Revisions
With design work, changes and revisions are common. Factoring that design is an iterative process, students are __sometimes__ allowed to revise and resubmit assignments. Re-submitting work is a __privilege__ granted at the instructor's discretion.

If you are re-submitting work:

1. You must have submitted the work by its due date. Late work is not eligible for re-submission.
2. The privilege to revise submitted work is only available for students who submitted substantial work; incomplete or dysfunctional work is not eligible for resubmission. This is at the instructor's discretion.
3. You may only recover partial points lost.

## Required Readings and Materials
### Text
There is no assigned text. The recommended text is:
[Graphic Design: The New Basics](https://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Design-Basics-Revised-Expanded/dp/161689332X) by Ellen Lupton

### Lynda.com
Use [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/portal/sip?org=mcpl.info) to learn your design software.

It is widely regarded as the best tutorial site in terms of the volume and quality of content available.

And it's free!

You can access Lynda videos and exercise files by getting a free Monroe County Library card. Access Lynda through the library’s website: <https://mcpl.monroe.lib.in.us/>

### Software
You will need access to:

 * Adobe Illustrator
 * Adobe Photoshop
 * Adobe Lightroom
 * Figma
 * Webflow

Both Figma and Webflow are both free, browser-based utilities.

### Hardware
While design can be done from any operating system, the instructor teaches workflow for OS X users. Access to a computer with Mac OS X is recommended but not required. All students should have access to a Mac through the computer lab. Students who aren't using OS X are expected to learn PC keyboard shortcuts and find Windows-compatible substitutes for software.

It is also useful to have access to a large display, or dual display configuration.

__Get a mouse.__ They are inexpensive and it will make you work MUCH faster.

## Policies
### Attendance
Students should make a serious effort to attend every lecture (online or in person). While attendance is not taken, I believe **attendance is the strongest guarantor of success** in this course.

Course material is cumulative in nature and class periods are used to develop skills and work on projects. You will also miss out on participation activities if you miss class.

Students are expected to come on time and stay for the duration of the class period. __A repeated pattern of tardiness is not tolerated.__

### Hybrid Format
Half of you attend class in-person on Monday and on Zoom Wednesday.
Half of you attend class in-person on Wednesday and on Zoom Monday.

I will specify this through an e-mail before the start of class (please check your Canvas inbox)

After Thanksgiving, everything is online.

### Deadlines
Deadlines are strict and non-negotiable. Late assignments will be accepted for the first three calendar days after a deadline. I will remove 15% for each day past the deadline _(Example--- If you got 85 on an assignment but submitted it two days late, you're getting a 55)_.

Assignments may not be submitted after three calendar days have elapsed (Example--- Deadline is September 8th, you cannot submit after September 11th)

The only __exception to this rule__ is the final project, which cannot be submitted late.

### Absences
Whether or not an absence is excused is __entirely at the discretion of the instructor__.

If you miss a participation exercise and have an __excused absence__, you have __one week__ to make up that assignment at office hours. If you cannot attend scheduled office hours, it is your responsibility to reach out and schedule another meeting time.

If you know you are going to be absent or late on a certain day, please tell me ahead of time.

### Lost Data
You are responsible for keeping backups/duplicates of your files.

I **highly recommend** getting an [IU Google Drive](https://uits.iu.edu/google) account. It is free, helps you to stay organized, and most importantly provides **backups** for your files.

Losing your files is not an excuse for late or incomplete work.

### Contacting the Instructor
You should use Canvas inbox or e-mail to contact me.

Make sure you tell me:

 * Who you are
 * What class you're in

### Food and Drink in Class
Sorry, they are not permitted.

### Self-care
Make an effort to take care of yourself. I value you deeply as a student and you should make an effort to take care of your mental well-being.

Meditation is an efficient and effective way to manage stress, improve cognitive performance, and overall health. You can get the [Headspace Student Plan](https://www.headspace.com/studentplan) for $9.99/yr.

IU provides [Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)](https://healthcenter.indiana.edu/counseling/index.html). This center is staffed with specialists who work tirelessly to help struggling students with a variety of student life problems.

### Students with Disabilities
If any student requires assistance or academic accommodations for a disability, please contact me by after class, by e-mail, or during office hours. The student must have established eligibility for disability support services through the Office of Disability Services for Students.

For more information--- [https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/disability-services-students/](https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/disability-services-students/)

### Academic Integrity
As a student at IU, you are expected to adhere to the standards and policies detailed in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct (Code). When you submit an assignment with your name on it, you are signifying that the work contained therein is yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. All suspected violations of the Code will be reported to the Dean of Students and handled according to University policies. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment, reduction in your final course grade, and a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities. If you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or exam, be sure to seek clarification beforehand.

#### Use of Design Assets
Sometimes it is acceptable to use existing design assets--- stock photos, icons, etc.

However, you MUST consult the instructor beforehand, unless I have explicitly said it's okay.

Presenting others' work as your own is unacceptable.

### Sexual Misconduct
As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to create a positive learning environment for all students. Title IX and IU’s Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibit sexual misconduct in any form, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and domestic violence.  If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone who has, the University can help.
If you are seeking help and would like to speak to someone confidentially, you can make an appointment with:

 * The Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS) at (812) 855-8900 (counseling services)
 * Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at (812) 856-2469 (advocacy and advice services)
 * IU Health Center at (812) 855-4011 (health and medical services)

It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct, with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU’s Title IX Coordinator.  In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available.   Protecting student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist.
I encourage you to visit stopsexualviolence.iu.edu to learn more.


### Religious Holidays

*It is the policy of Indiana University that instructors must reasonably accommodate students who want to observe their religious holidays at times when academic requirements conflict with those observances. This policy is intended to ensure that both faculty and students are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in the accommodation of students' religious observances.*
