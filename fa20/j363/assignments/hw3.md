# Homework Three --- <small>Stylescape and sketch</small>
## Description
Before you do anything, read the description for [Project Three](p3.html).

You will create a stylescape for this project.

### Step 1 Come up with an idea
For this project, it should be something that:
 * Is exciting/interesting to you
 * Will serve as a good portfolio piece
 * Challenges you
 * Makes use of all the skills we've built up until now

### Step 2 Look at some existing stylescapes
 * [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGmPCutgI2o) by TheFutur has a good overview of the process.
 * [Dribbbl](https://dribbble.com/tags/stylescape) has an excellent collection of stylescapes
 * [This pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/jerfink/stylescapes/) has some great stylescapes
 * The [inspiration](../inspiration.html) section of this site can help too

### Step 3 download the stylescape template
<div class="card-block">
  <p class="card-text">Get the template here:</p>
  <a href="hw3-lastname-firstname.pptx" class="btn btn-primary text-white" target="_blank">Download template</a>
</div>

You are also welcome to create your own format as long as we can output it to a `.pdf` of some sort.

### Step 4 fill out the stylescape
 Imagery and links in the stylescape should give us an idea of the __brand identity__ not just __the product itself__. 
 
Stylescape should give ideas for:
 * Typography
 * Color schemes
 * Overall look and feel
 * Personality/character of the brand
 * Interface design
 * Photography and imagery
 
Other stuff that might be fun to include:
 * Patterns/textures/materials
 * Packaging
 * Photography
 * Architecture if it's a brick-and-mortar business


### Step 5 complete a basic pencil/paper sketch of your site
It does not have to be detailed or pretty; it should serve to inform the high-level structure of your site. The idea is that when you begin Project Three you can easily fill out the 'skeleton' of your site.

## Submission - Canvas
You need to have two things:

1. A `.pdf` of your stylescape slides. You can create this in any format (you don't have to necessarily use the template I provide) as long as you can get it into one `.pdf` document.
2. A `sketch` of your site layout. 

Submit your stylescape `.pdf` to: `CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > HOMEWORK 3`
