# Project One - <small>Sketching and Lofi Prototypes</small> `15 pts.`
## Description
Project One involves sketching out a game interface, and generating a minimal, low-fidelity prototype with Illustrator.

You will be given a very basic idea of a game with a constraint. You will generate prototypes for this game idea.

This project is meant to familiarize you with:

1. Rapid iteration sketching
2. Planning out an interface
3. Generating a lofi prototype in Illustrator

## Prompt

## Deliverables
You will submit `a single zip file` that contains:

1. A text description of your game (`.docx`, `.doc`, or `.txt`)
2. Three or more hand-drawn sketches (`png` or `jpg`)
4. Illustrator file (`.ai`)
3. Three or more low-fidelity prototypes from Illustrator (export as `pdf`)

### 1) Text description
A short text description of your game idea (about 100-300 words is good). I just want to get a basic feel for the game.

Please submit this as a Word file (`.docx` or `.doc`) or a text file (`.txt`).

### 2) Sketches
You will submit `three or more` hand-drawn sketches.

Sketches should be:

 * Scanned images. __DO NOT__ take a picture.
 * Legible. I know sketches aren't expected to be neat and precise, but please make sure I can read important text.
 * Black and white sketches.
 * Detailed enough that I can get a feel for the game, but not so detailed that they resemble a finish product

### 3) Illustrator File
Your submission needs an Illustrator file (`.ai`)

Expectations:

1. Illustrator file should not be massive (<50mb is good)
2. Use layers if necessary. Layers should have meaningful names. _(e.g., avoid 'Layer 1', 'Layer 2', 'Layer 3'...)_
3. You should have three artboards. They should have meaningful names.
4. No linked files/embedded files
5. Use of grids/guides is appropriate but not absolutely required.
6. Some attention to detail is observed; if you intend to align two menu items to the left, they should be aligned with precision. Avoid "eyeballing" and try to use precise tools (grid/guide/ruler) wherever possible.

### 4) Illustrator Exports
Export as a single `.pdf` file that contains all three artboards.


## Process
### 1) Ideation and Sketching
Given the prompt, come up with a game idea.

For your game:

1. Screens and interface change throughout the course of gameplay
2. Interface interaction is a major part of the game
3. Buttons, menus, text, and other interface components are plentiful

#### ....

### 2) Asset Generation
You will use Illustator, Photoshop, or anything else you like, to create the screens for your game. Choose dimensions before starting and stick to them. If you're not sure what to use, I'd recommend `1280 by 768 pixels`.

### 3) Build Prototype
Use InVision _(or other software)_ to create your prototype. You are expected to begin working early so that you can get feedback and suggestions before the due date.

## Submission - Canvas
I need two things:

1. You will submit your project on Canvas a URL. You will give me your InVision/Axure shareable URL for this project. If you are using InVision, make sure to add me as a collaboratorâ€” `naguirre (at) indiana.edu`
2. You will give me your assets. For most of you, this will mean giving me your `.ai` (Illustrator) files.
