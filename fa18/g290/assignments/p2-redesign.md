# Project Two - <small>UI Re-design</small> `15 pts.`
## Description
For Project Two, you will choose a game with poor UI and create a re-designed, high-fidelity mockup.

You are suggested to use Illustrator or Photoshop.

### Choosing a game
 * The chosen game should be fairly UI-heavy _(e.g., an MMORPG is probably a better choice than an endless runner)_
 * Choose a game in which the UI presents substantial usability problems _(UI should be dysfunctional, not just ugly)_
 * Your re-design should be markedly different from the original. This is a complete re-design, not just polishing or resizing buttons.
 * Find a high-resolution screenshot with no UI and re-design on top of it.

Some games with bad UI that are easy to redesign:
 * Skyrim
 * Dark Souls
 * The Witcher
 * World of Warcraft
 * Playstation All Stars
 * Call of Duty


## Process


## Deliverables
You will submit a single `.zip` file that contains:

1. ~200-300 word description of UI problems in your chosen game (`.docx`, `.pdf` or `.txt`). Try to use descriptive language that reflects principles discussed in __Omer Younas'__ talk or in class.
2. Source screenshot (high-resolution `.jpg` or `.png`)
3. Illustrator or Photoshop files (`.ai`, `.psd`)
4. High-resolution rendering of your finished re-design (`.jpg`, `.png`, or `.pdf`)

## Submission - Canvas
You will submit a single `.zip` file with everything. See the __deliverables__ section above for details.
