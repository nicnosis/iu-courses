# Homework Four--- <small>Style Guide</small>
## Description
You will make a visual style guide. This can be for a project you've made (in this class or any other), or for an existing game that needs a style update.

### Alternative assignment
You can create a tutorial in the form of a video (or video series), or an article.

Your tutorial should:

 * Provide value to viewers
 * Allow viewers to easily replicate the result
 * Force you to carefully consider your process

## Style Guide Requirements
### Format
Submit either a `.pdf` or a Figma URL.

If you are doing this in Figma, __you are expected to define styles__.

### 1) Color scheme
You are recommended to have between two and five colors.

You must specify when a color is used--- e.g., blue for primary/dominant color, red for warning color etc. Read [this guide](https://blog.prototypr.io/basic-ui-color-guide-7612075cc71a) for details.

You may find variations helpful.

If you are using gradients, you must define the two (or more) colors used.

Here's a great example: [Firefox Color Guide](https://design.firefox.com/photon/visuals/color.html)

### 2) Typography
I __highly recommend__ having at most two font families.

You must have at least three variations with samples of each. Example:
 * 24pt Bold Oswald for headings
 * 18pt Bold Oswald for secondary headings
 * 14pt Open Sans for body copy
 * 11pt Open Sans for captions

__DO NOT__ use _lorem ipsum_ or placeholder text; populate meaningful content.

Here's a great example of a [detailed typography guide](http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel/guidelines/typography). You don't need quite this level of detail, but it's helpful.

### 3) Spacing and Margin Specs
This will include details of spacing, sizing, and positioning elements.

Examples:
 * Buttons will be 40px tall, at least 100 px wide and no wider than 300px
 * Buttons will have 8px vertical margins
 * All corner- or side-anchored panels will be 20px from the outer edge of the screen
 * UI components will be aligned to a six-column grid

### 4) Visual treatment and effects
You will consider details of UI components and how they impact the look/feel of your game.

Examples:
 * All buttons will have a drop-shadow, 5px x offset, 5px y offset, 10px radial blur, 70% opacity #000000 (define this as a style if you're doing Figma)
 * All buttons have 1px solid #CCCCCC stroke
 * Panels have a 45-degree notch in the top-left and bottom-right corners
 * Common textures and shaders, visual effects (e.g., chromatic abberation) if applicable
 * Art direction specs if applicable

### 5) Component Library
Once you develop and refine your style guide, you will build a component library.

Showcase used components, and provide detailed hierarchy. E.g., if you have a 'panel' component you should list subpanels, buttons inside subpanels, icons and text inside buttons, etc. This is a chance to show a practical application of the specs you developed in the previous steps.

Components that have multiple states (e.g., hover, selected, disabled) should be indicated.

The idea is that if you have a button in your app, it looks the same everywhere.

### 6) Other stuff
Depending on your project, you might also consider:

 * Iconography
 * Branding (e.g., mission statement, voice/tone, customer experience)
 * Illustration and art direction
 * Logo treatment
 * Motion/interaction

### Considerations for Grading

 * Consistent look and feel
 * Use of styles in Figma, use of prefabs in Unity
 * Attention to detail
 * Sized and position of elements
 * Completeness of component library
 * Observation of standard conventions
 * Style Guide should give audience a strong idea of what the complete product looks like. Other designers should be able to effortlessly implement your style guide.

### Inspiration
You will benefit greatly from looking at existing style guides and design systems. I recommend checking the `inspiration` tab on this page.

### Submission
Submit either a `.pdf` document or a Figma URL.
