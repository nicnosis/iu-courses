# Project One
## Getting Started
For Homework One, you will use `InDesign` to assemble a newspage. I will provide five stories, with text and images, that you must arrange into a newspage layout in InDesign. You may use as few as two stories and as many as five.

Download the starter files (below) and unzip, then read `newspage-instructions.pdf`. This PDF will take you through the assignment.

### About these files
You'll see a few folders...

 * There are five numbered folders. Each is a story with text and images. You can use as few as two and as many as all five of these.
 * You need to have promos - advertisements for products/services, and/or spaces advertising another story in the paper. The `PROMOS` folder has everything you need for this.
 * The `newspage.indt` file is what you will start with.
 * `newspage-instructions.pdf` will guide you through everything

## Inspiration
### Exemplary Layouts
You are __highly encouraged__ to look at attractive newspage layouts for inspiration. Here are some starting points:

 * [Newseum](http://www.newseum.org/todaysfrontpages/) - Great collection of front pages
 * [Magazine Page Elements](http://www.magazinedesigning.com/magazine-page-elements/)
 * [What to do With Picture Captions](http://www.magazinedesigning.com/what-to-do-with-picture-captions/)
 * [50 Incredible Editorial Designs From Around The World](https://designschool.canva.com/blog/editorial-design/)
 * [Modular Design: The Complete Primer for Beginners](https://designshack.net/articles/layouts/modular-design-the-complete-primer-for-beginners/)

A simple search for "newspage layout" or "modular design layout" on Google or Pinterest can also elicit many ideas.

### Guideline (slides)
I don't usually give powerpoint slides, but I have assembled some select slides as references. You can download them here:

## Submission
CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > PROJECT ONE

I need two things from you:

 * Your InDesign file (.indd) - name it `newspage_lastname-firstname.indd`
 * A PDF export of your file (.pdf) - name it `newspage_lastname-firstname.pdf`

Put both files into a folder named `newspage_lastname-firstname` and `compress` it into a `.zip` file. You will submit that single archive file to Canvas.

### Due Date
This assignment is due __FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 22nd__ @ 11:59pm.

## Grading
Grading is detailed in `newspage-instructions.pdf`. Note that the place where most students lose points is 'correctness of submission'; make sure your filenames are correct.
