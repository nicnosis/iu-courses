# Project Four--- Visual Identity Design
## Description
One of the functions of graphic design is to provide a visual identity for branding purposes. Elements such as logos, color schemes, patterns, and recurring imagery are used to build identities for both companies and individuals.

For this project, you will imagine a fictional company--- a product, service, or app--- and design a visual identity for it.


## Part 1--- Ideation `5 pts.`
_(This will count as your fourth homework assignment)_

Download the following template:

 <div class="card-block">
    <h4 class="card-title">Template: Product Idea</h4>
    <div class="spacer-1rem"></div>
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O_jetVKsUGoWR8PS8BlCycATp9y7kLbc2rolnUoVrPA/edit?usp=sharing" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">View Template</a>
 </div>

You will need to use Google Docs or Microsoft Word to edit this.

__Make sure to include this file in your final submission__.

## Part 2--- Deliverables `15 pts.`
You will build a style guide that showcases the look and feel of your fictional product. The style guide is a small booklet (or set of slides) that demonstrates your visual design rules.

### Requirements
You will need __at least three__ of these:

1. Color scheme
2. Logo--- This can be a symbol, wordmark, or combination of both
3. Patterns or imagery--- _(e.g., Recurring visual motif. This might be a pattern you use, or a graphical element such as a star)_
4. Typography sample with tagline, motto, or phrase _(e.g., "Just do it.")_
5. An app icon (if your product is an application)
6. A visual mockup of a product _(e.g., business card/stationery)_

### Format
You can use any format you like, as long as the output is a `.pdf`.

For most of you, the easiest will be:
 * Illustrator (use artboards)
 * PowerPoint presentation
