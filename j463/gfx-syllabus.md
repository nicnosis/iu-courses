## Description
Graphic design is everywhere. It is used to communicate, persuade, express feelings and establish identity. In today's digital landscape, graphic design has never been more prevalent. It determines how you read and process information, and what ideas you associate with visual imagery.

Graphic design is a powerful tool for conveying ideas and messages. Fundamentally, it is about communication. This course is designed to give you skills that will serve you in other disciplines. You will learn a powerful visual language that can be applied to any visual medium.

### Prerequisites
```
MSCH-C 226 or JOUR-J 210
```

## Objectives
In this course, you will:

 * Learn universal principles of design (e.g., proportion, size, position, color)
 * Develop mastery of digital tools used for graphic design - particularly Adobe software
 * Build an effective workflow and digital work environment
 * Create several attractive portfolio pieces
 * Learn to think and see differently
 * Discover and strengthen your creative faculties
 * Analyze why some approaches to design work better than others
 * Gain a foundation for expanding your design skills in any context

## Structure
This course is divided into __four units__, each about 3-4 weeks in length. Each unit will cover a different Adobe technology:

 * Unit One: InDesign
 * Unit Two: Photoshop
 * Unit Three: Illustrator
 * Unit Four: Muse

## Work
### Use of Class Time
This class is project-driven, and demands consistent effort inside and outside of the classroom. Classes are intended to be variable and may feature lectures, tutorials, in-class exercises, discussions and lab time. An effort is made to create a more interactive and less passive experience for students.

### Projects (60 pts.)
This class features __four__ creative projects; one for each unit. Each project gives you an opportunity to produce a strong portfolio piece; this will serve you both inside and outside of class.

### Homework (20 pts.)
This class has __four__ homework assignments designed to test and reinforce knowledge from class. Homework assignments are intended to keep your skills sharp and prepare you for your projects.

### Quizzes (20 pts.)
This course has __eight__ unannounced quizzes. The quizzes should be fairly straightforward if you have been participating in class.

### Readings and Tutorials
You will generally be asked to complete a reading or tutorial outside of class over the weekend. Most of the tutorials will be videos from Lynda.com.

Failure to keep up with readings and tutorials will make it difficult to do well on projects, homework, and quizzes.

### Final
There is no final exam for this class.

### Extra Credit
There will be __one__ opportunity this semester to earn __2 pts.__ of extra credit.  
You can either (a) participate in an ICR research study, or (b) create a short video tutorial for a graphic design technique.

## Grading
### Points
There are a total of **100** points in this class. The grade is divided as follows:

| Assignment             |  Points |
|:-----------------------|--------:|
| Projects (15 pts each) |      60 |
| Homeworks (5 pts each) |      20 |
| Quizzes (2.5 pts each) |      20 |
| **Total**              | **100** |

### Course Grade
Your grade will be assigned as follows:

| Points     | Grade |
|:-----------|:------|
| 90 - 100   | A     |
| 80 - 89.99 | B     |
| 70 - 78.99 | C     |
| 60 - 69.99 | D     |
| below 60   | F     |

Grading criteria will be given for each individual assignment.

## Revisions
When working with clients, customers, and co-workers, revisions are common. Factoring that graphic design is an iterative process, students are __sometimes__ allowed to revise and resubmit assignments. Re-submitting work is a __privilege__ granted at the instructor's discretion.

If you are re-submitting work:
1. You must have submitted the work by its due date. Late work is not eligible for re-submission.
2. The privilege to revise submitted work is only available for students who submitted substantial work; incomplete or dysfunctional code is not eligible for resubmission. This is at the instructor's discretion.
3. You may only recover partial points lost.

## Required Readings and Materials
### Text
There is no required text, but I recommend reading [Universal Principles of Design](http://a.co/cI4o0VL) by William Lidwell et al. This is a fantastic book regardless of what job you intend to do in the future.

### Lynda
You want access to Lynda.com, which can be obtained FREE with a [Monroe County Public Library](https://mcpl.info/) card.

### Adobe Software
We will be four Adobe products - InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator and Muse.

Go to [iuware.iu.edu](https://iuware.iu.edu) to download Adobe Creative Cloud applications.
We will be using CC 2017 in this class.

#### File Storage
 You really need a way to keep backups of your files! [Box](https://uits.iu.edu/box) is recommended. Google Drive and Dropbox are good alternatives. **Lost data is not an excuse for late or missing work**, so it is extremely important to have duplicate files for your work.

### Hardware
While graphic design can be done from any operating system, the instructor teaches workflow for OS X users. Access to a computer with Mac OS X is recommended but not required. All students should have access to a Mac through the computer lab. Students who aren't using OS X are expected to learn PC keyboard shortcuts.

It is also useful to have access to a large display, or dual display configuration. If you are bringing your own laptop to class, it is recommended to bring a mouse.

## Policies

### Attendance
Students should make a serious effort to attend every lecture. While attendance is not taken, I believe **attendance is the strongest guarantor of success** in this course.

Course material is cumulative in nature and class periods are used to develop programming skills and work on projects. You will also miss out on quizzes and participation activities if you miss class.

### Lost Data
You are responsible for keeping backups/duplicates of your files. As an IU student, you should have access to a Box account. You can also use Google Drive or Box to maintain copies of your files. Losing your files is not an excuse for late or incomplete work.

I **highly recommend** getting a [Box](https://uits.iu.edu/box) account. It is free, helps you to stay organized, and most importantly provides **backups** for your files.

### Food and Drink in Class
Sorry, they are not permitted.

### Deadlines
Deadlines are strict and non-negotiable. Late assignments will be accepted for the first five calendar days after a deadline. After that, I will remove 10% daily. Assignments may not be submitted after five calendar days have elapsed (Example - Deadline is September 8th, you cannot submit after September 13th)

The only __exception to this rule__ is the final project, which cannot be submitted late.

### Students with Disabilities
If any student requires assistance or academic accommodations for a disability, please contact me by after class, by e-mail, or during office hours. The student must have established eligibility for disability support services through the Office of Disability Services for Students.  

For more information - [https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/disability-services-students/](https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/disability-services-students/)

### Academic Integrity
As a student at IU, you are expected to adhere to the standards and policies detailed in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct (Code). When you submit an assignment with your name on it, you are signifying that the work contained therein is yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. All suspected violations of the Code will be reported to the Dean of Students and handled according to University policies. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment, reduction in your final course grade, and a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities. If you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or exam, be sure to seek clarification beforehand.

#### Use of Others' Assets
Anything you make in this class must be __100 percent created by you__. You are allowed to borrow ideas, use images for reference, or imitate another artist's creative style, but you cannot steal photos/images without attribution.

There are some instances in which it might be appropriate to use copyright- and royalty-free images. In this case, you must have my explicit consent, and you must give proper attribution to the source.

### Sexual Misconduct
As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to create a positive learning environment for all students. Title IX and IU’s Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibit sexual misconduct in any form, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and domestic violence.  If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone who has, the University can help.
If you are seeking help and would like to speak to someone confidentially, you can make an appointment with:

 * The Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS) at (812) 855-8900 (counseling services)
 * Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at (812) 856-2469 (advocacy and advice services)
 * IU Health Center at (812) 855-4011 (health and medical services)

It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct, with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU’s Title IX Coordinator.  In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available.   Protecting student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist. 
I encourage you to visit stopsexualviolence.iu.edu to learn more.


### Religious Holidays 

*It is the policy of Indiana University that instructors must reasonably accommodate students who want to observe their religious holidays at times when academic requirements conflict with those observances. This policy is intended to ensure that both faculty and students are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in the accommodation of students' religious observances.*
