# Homework One - <small>Bad Design</small>
## Description
1. Find a `game, app, or website` with poor user experience. You are recommended to play _A Boy and His Blob (1989)_.
2. Identify three things that made the experience unsatisfactory. This might include: control scheme; navigation; menus; icons/graphical elements; etc. __It is helpful to include screenshots if you can find them.__
3. For each identified problem, suggest a solution.

This assignment is intended to be very simple; don't overthink it! Remember that `you are a user` that your experience of the game/app/website is valid.


## Submission - Canvas
You may type your submission directly into the Canvas assignment. If you have screenshots, attach them.
