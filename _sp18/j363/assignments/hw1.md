# Homework One - <small>Basic HTML Tags</small>
## Description
You will create a simple profile for yourself using basic HTML tags.

Your finished product should look like [this](img/hw1-finished.png)

## Grading and Requirements
Homeworks are worth `five points` in this course. Grading criteria are detailed below.

### File and Folder names `1 pt.`
 * DO NOT use spaces in your filenames. Use hyphens instead
 * DO NOT use capital letters in your filenames
 * Make sure your HTML file is called `index.html`. This is the standard filename for a site
 * Your site folder should be named `hw1_lastname-firstname` _(e.g., hw1_aguirre-nicolas)_
 * You will submit a `.zip` file. Right click on your site folder and choose `compress`. Make sure this file is called `hw1_lastname-firstname.zip`

### Code Quality `1 pt.`
Your code should:

 * Be free of extraneous whitespaces
 * Use proper indentation to show structure with nested tags - It should be easy to read for me
 * Follow conventions described in class and in the reading _(e.g., do not capitalize tags, use quotation marks when specifying an attribute)_

### Image `1 pt.`
 * Make sure your image is included in your submission
 * Your `<img>` tag's `src` attribute should correctly reference the image
 * Your image should be reasonably sized. If it's too big/small, use the `width` and `height` attributes to adjust

### HTML Tags `2 pts.`
You should use these:

 * `<title>` - do not leave this empty
 * `<h1>` and `<h2>`
 * `<p>`
 * `<ul>` with `<li>`
 * `<blockquote>`. See [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_blockquote.asp) for more details

Your tags should be:

 * Written in lower case
 * Properly nested; don't start another tag before closing the one you're in
 * Indented to line up properly

### Style `1 bonus pt.`
You'll get `1 bonus point` on this assignment if you make some stylistic changes.

Put a `<style>` tag in your `<head>`. Use CSS to:

 * Select `body` and change its `font-family` property to `'Arial'` or another sans-serif font
 * Select `h1, h2` and change its `color` property to `crimson` or another color

## Submission - Canvas
Submit your compressed file _(zip)_ to: `CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > HOMEWORK 1`
