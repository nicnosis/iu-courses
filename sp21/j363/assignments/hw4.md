# Homework Four --- <small>p5.js</small>
## Description
In this assignment, you will familiarize yourself with JavaScript, and the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.

I have set up a simple p5.js sketch, and you will modify it to match the desired result. Instead of having to write all the code from scratch, you are making edits to my code.

<div class="card-block">
  <h6 class="card-text">Your finished sketch will look like this one:</h6>
  <img src="img/hw4-finished.png" alt="homework 4 finished" class="img-fluid">
</div>

## Process
### Step One: Fork my pen
<div class="card-block">
  <p class="card-text lead">Starter pen</p>
  <h6 class="card-text">Make sure you're logged in to CodePen. Fork this pen, save it to your 'j363' collection, then you can start:</h6>
  <a href="https://codepen.io/novonagu/pen/WzmGrZ" class="btn btn-primary text-white" target="_blank">Starter Pen</a>
</div>

### Step Two: p5.js tutorials and resources
Once you've forked the starter pen, you can get started.

You should consult the official [p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/), which includes examples.

The methods you will want to understand are:
 * createCanvas()
 * fill()
 * stroke()
 * noStroke()
 * strokeWeight()
 * line()
 * ellipse()
 * rect()



#### Tutorial
You may also like Dan Shiffman's [p5.js tutorials on YouTube](https://youtu.be/D1ELEeIs0j8). He is using Brackets, but we can use Codepen.

### Step Three: Make changes
You will want to change the "Your name here" part of the `HTML`, otherwise all changes will be made on the `JS` panel.

Pay attention to the comments in the code. This will guide you to the changes you need to make.

## Step Four: Submit to Canvas
1. Make sure you have forked the pen. It should say "A pen by [your name]"
2. Submit the URL to Canvas: `ASSIGNMENTS > HOMEWORK 4`
