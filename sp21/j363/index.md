Notes:

1. I understand you're new to Webflow and that this exercise is very nuanced. It's okay if yours doesn't look identical to my example, but at least give it your best shot. It should closely resemble the example given, but no need to split hairs over a few pixels here and there.
2. Also note that these videos are from a previous semester so __the filenames will be different.__

This is a __wellness day.__ Please take care of yourself and remember that __sometimes resting is the most productive thing you do.__
