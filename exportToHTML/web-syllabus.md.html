<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Structure</span>
<span class="s1">This course is divided into </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">four units</span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s1">, each about 3-4 weeks in length.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Unit One: HTML</span>
<span class="s1">Unit One tackles the basics of web design and HTML, which is used to create the structural elements and content of a website. Class time will be spent familiarizing yourself with your text editor, analyzing websites, and learning fundamental web design concepts.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Unit Two: CSS</span>
<span class="s1">Unit Two focuses on CSS, which is used to control the style and appearance of HTML elements. You will learn how to import, create, and work with stylesheets. This unit will give you more creative control over how your sites look and feel.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Unit Three: Webflow</span>
<span class="s1">Unit Three will acquaint you with </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">Webflow</span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s1">, a powerful emerging software for creating responsive websites quickly.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Unit Four: JavaScript</span>
<span class="s1">Unit Four will introduce you to JavaScript. This unit will teach you how to introduce functionality and behavior into your website, while learning valuable programming principles that can be applied to other languages.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Work</span>
<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Use of Class Time</span>
<span class="s1">This class is project-driven, and demands consistent effort inside and outside of the classroom. Classes are intended to be variable and may feature lectures, tutorials, in-class exercises, discussions and lab time. An effort is made to create a more interactive and less passive experience for students.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Projects (55 pts.)</span>
<span class="s1">This class features </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">four</span><span class="s3">__ </span><span class="s1">large-scale web design projects.</span>

<span class="s0">#### </span><span class="s2">Project 1--- HTML Tags and Attributes (10 pts.)</span>
<span class="s1">You will construct a basic website outline using HTML. This project assesses students' knowledge of HTML tags and basic site structure. Project 1 aims to familiarize students with their text editors and development tools.</span>

<span class="s0">#### </span><span class="s2">Project 2--- Styling and CSS (15 pts.)</span>
<span class="s1">The focus of Project 2 is CSS. You will demonstrate their ability to add visual elements and style to sites. Project 2 will test students' knowledge of CSS selectors, properties, and values, as well as the Box-Model.</span>

<span class="s0">#### </span><span class="s2">Project 3--- Webflow Site (15 pts.)</span>
<span class="s1">You will design, prototype, and develop a website using </span><span class="s8">[</span><span class="s1">Webflow</span><span class="s8">](</span><span class="s9">https://webflow.com/</span><span class="s8">)</span><span class="s1">. This project is designed to combine all of the skills you've acquired throughout the semester.</span>

<span class="s0">#### </span><span class="s2">Project 4--- JavaScript (15 pts.)</span>
<span class="s1">You will use Javascript to create an interactive visualization, with JavaScript's </span><span class="s8">[</span><span class="s1">p5.js</span><span class="s8">](</span><span class="s9">https://p5js.org/</span><span class="s8">) </span><span class="s1">library.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Homework (20 pts.)</span>
<span class="s1">This class has homework assignments designed to test and reinforce knowledge from class. Homework assignments typically involve a shorter or less involved coding task.</span>

<span class="s0">#### </span><span class="s2">Codecademy</span>
<span class="s1">You will be given assignments to complete on </span><span class="s8">[</span><span class="s1">Codecademy</span><span class="s8">](</span><span class="s9">https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css/</span><span class="s8">)</span><span class="s1">. In order to really learn and memorize code, you need to practice. While the Codecademy assignments are not graded, completing them will make your homeworks, projects, and quiz much easier.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Quizzes and Participation (20 pts.)</span>
<span class="s1">A quiz consists of either (a) an unannounced quiz or (b) an in-class lab activity. Quizzes are designed to ensure that students are completing their readings, Codecademy work, and following along with in-class coding activities.</span>

<span class="s1">Participation is an important element of this class. It is not enough to read about web design and its constituent languages; one must actively practice and hone their skills to be successful. </span>

<span class="s1">Many of our classes will focus on the completion of certain exercises, tutorials, and discussions. Most class days will feature a small participation exercise. They are to be finished during class and are generally graded on completion.</span>

<span class="s1">Students </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">must be physically present</span><span class="s3">__ </span><span class="s1">to claim a participation assignment. Coming to class late, leaving early, or attempting to submit participation while not present are all grounds for losing points.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Professionalism (5 pts.)</span>
<span class="s1">Students are expected to behave like adults. Unprofessional behavior will be met with a grade deduction in this category.</span>

<span class="s1">Unprofessional behavior includes (but is not limited to):</span>

 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Arriving to class late</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Leaving class early</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Failure to observe course policies</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Disrespect towards classmates or instructor</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Lack of consideration for classmates or instructor</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Behavior that distracts classmates or instructor</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Failure to practice academic integrity</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Excessive use of cell phone during class</span>


<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Final</span>
<span class="s1">There is no final exam for this class.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Course Grade</span>
<span class="s1">Your grade will be assigned as follows:</span>

<span class="s10">| </span><span class="s11">Grade </span><span class="s10">| </span><span class="s12">Range            </span><span class="s10">|</span>

<span class="s1">Grading criteria will be given for each individual assignment.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Revisions</span>
<span class="s1">When software is created in a professional environment, changes and revisions are common. Factoring that web development is an iterative process, students are </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">sometimes</span><span class="s3">__ </span><span class="s1">allowed to revise and resubmit assignments. Re-submitting work is a </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">privilege</span><span class="s3">__ </span><span class="s1">granted at the instructor's discretion.</span>

<span class="s1">If you are re-submitting work:</span>

<span class="s18">1. </span><span class="s1">You must have submitted the work by its due date. Late work is not eligible for re-submission.</span>
<span class="s18">2. </span><span class="s1">The privilege to revise submitted work is only available for students who submitted substantial work; incomplete or dysfunctional code is not eligible for resubmission. This is at the instructor's discretion.</span>
<span class="s18">3. </span><span class="s1">You may only recover partial points lost.</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Required Readings and Materials</span>
<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Text</span>
<span class="s1">There is no assigned text. Most readings will come in the form of articles, tutorials, or content from </span><span class="s8">[</span><span class="s1">W3Schools</span><span class="s8">](</span><span class="s9">http://w3schools.com</span><span class="s8">)</span><span class="s1">.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Codecademy</span>
<span class="s1">You will use </span><span class="s8">[</span><span class="s1">Codecademy</span><span class="s8">](</span><span class="s9">https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css/</span><span class="s8">)</span><span class="s1">, a free online learning environment, to practice your coding skills outside of class.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Software</span>
<span class="s1">Software is a focal point of this course, and an effort was made to ensure that free, cross-platform software will be used wherever possible. Tools, applications, and services prove invaluable in web development.</span>

<span class="s1">We will use:</span>

 <span class="s18">1. </span><span class="s1">A text editor--- </span><span class="s8">[</span><span class="s1">Atom</span><span class="s8">](</span><span class="s9">https://atom.io/</span><span class="s8">) </span><span class="s1">is recommended.</span>
 <span class="s18">2. </span><span class="s1">A means of version control--- </span><span class="s8">[</span><span class="s1">Box</span><span class="s8">](</span><span class="s9">https://uits.iu.edu/box</span><span class="s8">) </span><span class="s1">is recommended. Google Drive and Dropbox are good alternatives. </span><span class="s3">**</span><span class="s4">Lost data is not an excuse for late or missing work</span><span class="s3">**</span><span class="s1">, so it is extremely important to have duplicate files for your work.</span>



<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Hardware</span>
<span class="s1">While web development can be done from any operating system, the instructor teaches workflow for OS X users. Access to a computer with Mac OS X is recommended but not required. All students should have access to a Mac through the computer lab. Students who aren't using OS X are expected to learn PC keyboard shortcuts and find Windows-compatible substitutes for software.</span>

<span class="s1">It is also useful to have access to a large display, or dual display configuration. If you are bringing your own laptop to class, it is recommended to bring a mouse.</span>

<span class="s1">&lt;div style=&quot;page-break-after: always;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>

<span class="s0">## </span><span class="s2">Policies</span>
<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Attendance</span>
<span class="s1">Students should make a serious effort to attend every lecture. While attendance is not taken, I believe </span><span class="s3">**</span><span class="s4">attendance is the strongest guarantor of success</span><span class="s3">** </span><span class="s1">in this course.</span>

<span class="s1">Course material is cumulative in nature and class periods are used to develop programming skills and work on projects. You will also miss out on quizzes and participation activities if you miss class.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Deadlines</span>
<span class="s1">Deadlines are strict and non-negotiable. Late assignments will be accepted for the first three calendar days after a deadline. I will remove 15% for each day past the deadline </span><span class="s19">_</span><span class="s20">(Example--- If you got 85 on an assignment but submitted it two days late, you're getting a 55)</span><span class="s19">_</span><span class="s1">.</span>

<span class="s1">Assignments may not be submitted after three calendar days have elapsed (Example--- Deadline is September 8th, you cannot submit after September 11th)</span>

<span class="s1">The only </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">exception to this rule</span><span class="s3">__ </span><span class="s1">is the final project, which cannot be submitted late.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Absences</span>
<span class="s1">Whether or not an absence is excused is </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">entirely at the discretion of the instructor</span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s1">.</span>

<span class="s1">If you miss a quiz or participation exercise and have an </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">excused absence</span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s1">, you have </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">one week</span><span class="s3">__ </span><span class="s1">to make up that assignment at office hours. If you cannot attend scheduled office hours, it is your responsibility to reach out and schedule another meeting time.</span>


<span class="s1">If you know you are going to be absent or late on a certain day, please tell me ahead of time.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Lost Data</span>
<span class="s1">You are responsible for keeping backups/duplicates of your files. As an IU student, you should have access to a Box account. You can also use Google Drive or GitHub to maintain copies of your files. Losing your files is not an excuse for late or incomplete work.</span>

<span class="s1">I </span><span class="s3">**</span><span class="s4">highly recommend</span><span class="s3">** </span><span class="s1">getting a </span><span class="s8">[</span><span class="s1">Box</span><span class="s8">](</span><span class="s9">https://uits.iu.edu/box</span><span class="s8">) </span><span class="s1">account. It is free, helps you to stay organized, and most importantly provides </span><span class="s3">**</span><span class="s4">backups</span><span class="s3">** </span><span class="s1">for your files.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Email</span>
<span class="s1">If you e-mail me, make sure you tell me:</span>

 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Who you are</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">What class you're in</span>

<span class="s0">#### </span><span class="s2">Getting help with code</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Use Canvas to send a message to both me AND the teaching assistant. You can use (Send to &gt; Instructor) for this purpose.</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Include a screenshot if applicable </span><span class="s19">_</span><span class="s20">(e.g., something is displaying incorrectly)</span><span class="s19">_</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Include your code. To share your code--- compress your project folder, put it on Box, and share a downloadable link.</span>

<span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">It can be difficult to diagnose coding problems via e-mail.</span><span class="s3">__ </span><span class="s1">I'll do my best, but you should consider talking with me after class, or coming to office hours if you're struggling with an assignment.</span>

<span class="s1">I will do my best to correct code over the e-mail, but students should not expect me to correct </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">more than three lines of code in an e-mail</span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s1">.</span>

<span class="s1">Students should know that an e-mail response may take </span><span class="s3">__</span><span class="s4">up to 72 hours</span><span class="s3">__ </span><span class="s1">depending on the time of the semester.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Food and Drink in Class</span>
<span class="s1">Sorry, they are not permitted.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Students with Disabilities</span>
<span class="s1">If any student requires assistance or academic accommodations for a disability, please contact me by after class, by e-mail, or during office hours. The student must have established eligibility for disability support services through the Office of Disability Services for Students.</span>

<span class="s1">For more information--- </span><span class="s8">[</span><span class="s1">https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/disability-services-students/</span><span class="s8">](</span><span class="s9">https://studentaffairs.indiana.edu/disability-services-students/</span><span class="s8">)</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Academic Integrity</span>
<span class="s1">As a student at IU, you are expected to adhere to the standards and policies detailed in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct (Code). When you submit an assignment with your name on it, you are signifying that the work contained therein is yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. All suspected violations of the Code will be reported to the Dean of Students and handled according to University policies. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment, reduction in your final course grade, and a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities. If you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or exam, be sure to seek clarification beforehand.</span>

<span class="s0">#### </span><span class="s2">Proper Attribution for Referenced Works</span>
<span class="s1">By nature, code is re-usable and extensible. It is both acceptable and encouraged to utilize and adapt examples of code; this is common on websites like StackOverflow. However, the sources for all referenced code must be given in your code commenting. I will assist students with finding code that is reusable (such as under the GNU license), and help with giving proper credit to the source.</span>

<span class="s0">#### </span><span class="s2">Stealing code</span>
<span class="s1">Students may not share code samples with one another. If you are using code that you didn't write, without giving credit, you are cheating.</span>

<span class="s1">Students with code that is identical or very similar (more than 75% the same) are subject to losing points, or a failing grade.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Sexual Misconduct</span>
<span class="s1">As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to create a positive learning environment for all students. Title IX and IU’s Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibit sexual misconduct in any form, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and domestic violence.  If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone who has, the University can help.</span>
<span class="s1">If you are seeking help and would like to speak to someone confidentially, you can make an appointment with:</span>

 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">The Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS) at (812) 855-8900 (counseling services)</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at (812) 856-2469 (advocacy and advice services)</span>
 <span class="s6">* </span><span class="s1">IU Health Center at (812) 855-4011 (health and medical services)</span>

<span class="s1">It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct, with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU’s Title IX Coordinator.  In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available.   Protecting student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Religious Holidays</span>

<span class="s19">*</span><span class="s20">It is the policy of Indiana University that instructors must reasonably accommodate students who want to observe their religious holidays at times when academic requirements conflict with those observances. This policy is intended to ensure that both faculty and students are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in the accommodation of students' religious observances.</span><span class="s19">*</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Syllabus</span>
<span class="s1">This course is rich in content and skill levels vary widely among students. The instructor reserves the right to amend this syllabus to better match the needs of a given class.</span>

<span class="s0">### </span><span class="s2">Final Grade</span>
<span class="s1">The instructor reserves the right to adjust your final grade based on effort, participation, or conduct. This is uncommon.</span>
