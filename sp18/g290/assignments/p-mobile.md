# Project Three - <small>Mobile Game</small> `15 pts.` + `5 pts.`
## Description
For this assignment, you will work in teams to prototype a mobile game that fulfills the following prompt:

<div class="card-block">
  <p class="card-text lead">Location-based mobile game that connects strangers in a meaningful way.</p>
</div>

## Process
This project will follow suit with the previous ones we've done. By now, you should understand my expectations about:

1. Sketches
2. Low-fidelity prototyping
3. High-fidelity (polished) prototypes with assets

### Milestone
This project includes a milestone deadline that will count as your third homework.

Your third milestone is on **Wednesday March 28th** and will include:
1. I will need your interpretation of Project Three's prompt. This should be about 300 words to convey the idea and goals of your project. I will meet with each team to discuss your project idea.
2. You will present at least **three sketches** of screens from your game.
3. Each team will provide 15 examples (e.g., a mood board) of inspiration.
