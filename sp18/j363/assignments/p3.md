# Project Three --- <small>Bootstrap site `15 points`</small>
## Description
You will build a `single page website` using Bootstrap.

This project is designed to give you a lot of agency and creative control; I am not picky about what you want to do, as long as:

 * You use Bootstrap
 * You do not repeat one of your previous projects (unless I give consent)

Some ideas might be:
 * Landing page for a fictional agency
 * Portfolio page for your work
 * Another online shop (you may not use the same one as your last project without my permission)
 * Multimedia story/article

## Getting started
You'll want to start with these files:

<div class="card-block">
  <p class="card-text lead">Starter files for Project Three:</p>
  <a href="p3-start.zip" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">Download</a>
</div>

## Grading Criteria
This project is worth `fifteen points`.

### CSS and Visual Style `6 pts.`
Bootstrap gives us a lot to start with, but you will definitely want to write custom CSS.

 * Layout/structure is sensible
 * Consistent look and feel
 * Color palette is aesthetically pleasing
 * Mindful use of space --- Elements should not be too tight/cramped next to each other, but there should not be huge gaps between elements either.
 * Text is readable

### Project Milestones `3 pts.`
You will have a progress check on `Wednesday April 4th`. You are expected to have started the project and made substantial progress by this point.

### Bootstrap Components `3 pts.`
 * Make sure to use `at least three` Bootstrap components.
 * Components should be functional and serve a purpose.
 * Components should follow conventions detailed in the Bootstrap documentation.

You can check [the documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/) for a list of Bootstrap components and how to implement them.

### File and folder names `1 pts.`
 * DO NOT use spaces in your filenames. Use hyphens instead.
 * DO NOT use capital letters in your filenames
 * Before compressing your project, make sure the folder is named `p3_lastname-firstname` _(e.g., p3_aguirre-nicolas)_
 * Right-click on your site folder and choose `compress`. Make sure this file is called `p3_lastname-firstname.zip`. You will submit this `.zip` file.

### Code Quality `2 pts.`
Your code should:

 * Be free of extraneous whitespaces
 * Use concise, helpful comments
 * Use proper indentation to show structure with nested tags -- It should be easy to read for me
 * Follow conventions described in class and in the reading _(e.g., do not capitalize tags, use quotation marks when specifying an attribute)_

## Academic Integrity
You are allowed to use existing code from sources such as Bootstrap's documentation site. However, you must always reference code that you have taken from another source.

Many of the inspiration links will feature templates. Note that although you can consult templates to get ideas, __you may not build your site with a template__.

To clarify, here is the extent of what is allowed and what isn't:

### Allowed
 * Talking to a classmate to get ideas or suggestions
 * Looking at another student's code to identify bugs or problems
 * Including plugins or small code snippets from online, provided that they aren't templates, and that you cited the source.
 * Example--- you might build your navigation using code from the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/). This is fine.

### Not Allowed
 * Writing code for another student
 * Copying/pasting code between students
 * Sharing files between students
 * Copying/pasting code from online examples __without giving credit__
 * Using a template

## Submission - Canvas
Submit your compressed file _(zip)_ to: `CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > PROJECT 3`
