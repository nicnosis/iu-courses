# Homework Four --- <small>p5.js</small>
## Description
In this assignment, you will familiarize yourself with JavaScript, and the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.

I have set up a simple p5.js sketch, and you will modify it to match the desired result. Instead of having to write all the code from scratch, you are making edits to my code.

<div class="card-block">
  <h6 class="card-text">Your finished sketch will look like this one:</h6>
  <img src="img/hw4-finished.png" alt="homework 4 finished" class="img-fluid">
</div>

## Process
Before starting, you should have done some of the [Codecademy Javascript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript). You want to make sure you at least understand the basics: variables, control flow, and functions.

### Step One: Fork my pen
<div class="card-block">
  <p class="card-text lead">Starter pen</p>
  <h6 class="card-text">Make sure you're logged in to CodePen. Fork this pen, save it to your 'j363' collection, then you can start:</h6>
  <a href="https://codepen.io/novonagu/pen/WzmGrZ" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">Starter Pen</a>
</div>

### Step Two: p5.js tutorials and resources
Once you've forked the starter pen, you can get started.

There's two main resources that will be useful:
 * The official [p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/), which includes examples.
 * Dan Shiffman's [p5.js tutorials on YouTube](https://youtu.be/D1ELEeIs0j8). He is using Brackets, but we can use Codepen

### Step Three: Make changes
You will want to change the "Your name here" part of the `HTML`, otherwise all changes will be made on the `JS` panel.

Pay attention to the comments in the code. This will guide you to the changes you need to make.

## Step Four: Submit to Canvas
### `PLEASE PAY ATTENTION to these instructions so that you don't lose points`
1. When your sketch is finished, download it from Codepen by doing `Export > Export as .zip`
2. Unzip it. There should be a folder there. Rename it to `hw4_lastname-firstname`. _(e.g., hw4_aguirre-nicolas)_
3. Compress the folder after renaming it. The resulting archive file should be named `hw4_lastname-firstname.zip`. You should check to make sure that the folder inside is named accordingly.

Submit your compressed file _(zip)_ to: `CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > HOMEWORK 4`
