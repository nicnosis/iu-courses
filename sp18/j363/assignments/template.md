| Component              | Points  |
|:-----------------------|:--------|
| Part 1 - `.toggle()`   | 20      |
| Part 2 - `.css()`      | 20      |
| Part 3 - `.addClass()` | 20      |
| Part 4 - `.html()`     | 20      |

| **Total**              | **100** |

You can get `5 extra credit points` on part 3 by creating another button, that when clicked, removes the `shadow` class from the red square.

## Submission - Canvas
After you are done writing code, you can upload the entire folder to your site. The best way is to drag and drop the entire folder.

Submit the link to your assignment on Canvas.
