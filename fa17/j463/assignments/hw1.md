# Homework One
## Getting Started
For Homework One, you will use `InDesign` to assemble text and images into a simple article. This homework comes with starter files. Download them (below) and unzip, then read `HW1-INSTRUCTIONS.pdf`. This PDF will take you through the assignment.

  <div class="card-block">
    <h4 class="card-title">Starter Files</h4>
    <!--<p class="card-text">Click below to download</p>-->
    <a href="hw1.zip" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">Download</a>
  </div>

### About these files
You'll see a few folders...

 * The `FONTS` folder has _Adobe Garamond_ and _Handwriting_. You will need these fonts or similar ones
 * The `IMAGES` folder has image assets you will need
 * The `TEXT` folder has the body copy you will import into InDesign
 * `HW1-INSTRUCTIONS.pdf` will guide you through everything
 * `20 ways DONE.pdf` is an example of what the final product should look like
 * `20 ways START.indd` is the indesign file you will start with. Duplicate this file, and rename it `HW1_lastname-firstname.indd` _(e.g., HW1_Aguirre_Nicolas.indd)_

## Submission
CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > HOMEWORK ONE

I need two things from you:

 * Your indesign file (.indd) - name it `HW1_lastname-firstname.indd`
 * A PDF export of your file (.pdf) - name it `HW1_lastname-firstname.pdf`

Put both files into a folder named `HW1_lastname-firstname` and `compress` it into a `.zip` or `.rar` file. You will submit that single archive file to Canvas.

### Due Date
This assignment is due __FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 8th__ @ 11:59pm.

## Grading
Homeworks are worth `five points` each.

 * File names and formats `(1 pt)`. Your files should be named `HW1_lastname-firstname.indd` and `HW1_lastname-firstname.pdf`. They should be in a folder called `HW1_lastname-firstname`. That folder should be compressed into `HW1_lastname-firstname.zip`
 * Fonts `(1 pt)`. You should use _Adobe Garamond_, or a similar font, for the body copy. You should use _Poplar Std_ (or similar) for the heading. You should use _Handwriting_ or a similar font for the bottom-left section (next to the leaf)
 * Heading `(1 pt)`. Your header text should feature both the white and gold parts, and be appropriately sized and positioned.
 * Body copy `(1 pt)`. Your body copy should be properly threaded, aligned to the columns, and have the right amount of spacing.
 * Images `(1 pt)`. Your gardener and plant images should be appropriately sized and positioned.

While your homework might not look EXACTLY like the example, it should be pretty close.
