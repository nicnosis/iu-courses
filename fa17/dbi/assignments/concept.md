# Project One --- Brand Concept
## Description
You will select from a list of given industries. You will develop a __concept__ for a new brand; a product or service that fits into that industry. Example --- perhaps you chose the _food and drink_ industry and have an idea for a new bottled water brand.

You will produce a document with two parts:

1. An analysis of the current industry --- what are the leading brands and how do they position themselves?
2. Your brand concept --- what are you selling, what does your brand stand for, and how will you position it?

The goal of this assignment is to show that you can:

1. Analyze an industry
2. Develop a brand concept
3. Communicate your concept to others

You may work individually or in teams (up to three people on a team).

__Use the spreadsheet below to choose your industry/teams__.

## Requirements
### Format
You may produce any kind of document you like --- InDesign, Word, website. Your submission should either be a `pdf` file or a link to a website.

### Length
This is a writing assignment. The required word count depends on how many people are in your team.

 * Individual --- `300 words minimum`
 * Two people --- `500 words minimum`
 * Three people --- `600 words minimum`

These are guidelines--- you may use more or fewer words if necessary. __I am more concerned with quality than quantity.__

### Part 1: Industry inventory
Give me an overview of your industry. Here are some guidelines of what you might discuss:

 * Who are the leading brands in the industry? (pick at least two)
 * How do they market or position themselves?
 * How do these brands differentiate themselves? What makes them unique?
 * How do you think the public perceives these brands?
 * Describe the overall voice or character of these brands. _(e.g., Southwest is known for having a lighthearted and fun personality)_
 * What are the values and beliefs of these brands?
 * What kinds of advertisements do these brands use? TV ads? Word of mouth? Social media?

### Part 2: Conceptualization
Develop your brand concept. The idea is that you have a basic idea for a product/service and can communicate it to others. You must take the idea in your head and turn it into a vision that others can see.

 * What is your mission statement? You should be able to describe your mission in a couple of sentences or less.
 * Remember that __"people don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it."__ Why does your brand do what it does? What do you stand for?
 * Who is your target audience? What does your average customer look like?
 * What differentiates your product from existing products in the industry?
 * Explain (or show) the visual identity of your brand --- what colors, imagery, and themes can you use to visually communicate the value of your brand?
