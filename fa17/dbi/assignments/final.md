# Project Three--- Visual Story
## Description
You will put together a presentation for a branded, visual story. This will usually be in the form of a slide-based (e.g., PowerPoint) presentation. However, you are free to make a video, website, or other visually-engaging form of presentation.

The idea is to showcase your idea through a visual presentation. The audience should get a strong idea of the brand's identity, what it stands for, and its general look and feel.

This assignment is meant to produce __an attractive portfolio piece__ for you. It will impress people if you can (1) come up with a solid brand idea and (2) represent it visually.

## Requirements
Through watching your presentation, the audience should know the following things about your brand:

#### Brand character
Things to think about:

 * Who are you?
 * What do you stand for?
 * Vision, purpose, your _'Why'_
 * Attitudes, beliefs, ideals
 * Motivation, mission, goals

#### Visual Identity
We should understand the general look and feel of your brand. The best ways to represent this are:

1. Color scheme
2. Logo--- This can be a symbol, wordmark, or combination of both
3. Patterns, icons, and other imagery--- _(e.g., Recurring visual motif. This might be a pattern you use, or a graphical element such as a star)_
4. Fonts--- Typography sample with tagline, motto, or phrase _(e.g., "Just do it.")_.
5. Visual mockups are always helpful--- business card, stationery, billboard sign, etc.
6. If packaging is a major component of identity, then you should make a mockup of this _(e.g., a coffee cup with the logo on it)_
7. If you have an app, you should definitely make an app icon
8. If you have a website, consider a mockup or wireframe of the homepage.

These are all suggestions; the actual content will vary widely depending on what kind of product you have.

## Submission
There are two things I need from you.

1. An in-class presentation
2. A canvas submission (So I have your files)


### In-class Presentation
We want to see and hear about your brand. Prepare a presentation `of about five minutes` in whatever format you like. Expect to receive feedback and constructive criticism.

You will present your final project in class on **Monday Dec 11th at 7:15pm**.

`The final will take place in room FF060 which is next door to the one we usually meet in.`

These are informal presentations; any format is fine.

### Canvas Submission
