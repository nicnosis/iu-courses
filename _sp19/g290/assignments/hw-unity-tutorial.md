# Homework Three: Unity
This is a simple homework designed to get you warmed up to Unity _(or build your existing skills if you're experienced)_.

I want to make sure that you:

 * Feel comfortable with Unity
 * Know how to use source control
 * Can submit projects through your repository link

### Before you start
You will need:

 * Unity Hub _(We are using Unity version 2018.3.x)_
 * A Unity Account _(Use your @iu.edu account)_
 * A BitBucket account _(Sign up through the [education](https://bitbucket.org/product/education) link)_
 * SourceTree

### Option A: Beginners
If you are an absolute beginner, you should complete a tutorial that covers the basics of Unity.

 * I recommend the [Roll-A-Ball Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial) as it is a classic.
 * You can find [other tutorials here](https://unity3d.com/learn/beginner-tutorials)

All I want to see is that you have taken the time to complete a tutorial that gets you up to speed with Unity and gives you a basis to learn UI.

### Option B: Experienced
If you already feel pretty comfortable with Unity, you should take an existing project and add some UI to it.

 * I recommend taking some time to learn about the [Canvas](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UICanvas.html), Panel, and [UI](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UISystem.html) objects.

The easiest way to approach this is to get a project from the `Learn > Tutorial Projects` tab on Unity Hub, download it, and implement changes.

Examples of project you might do:
 * Adding a minimap to `Roll-A-Ball`
 * Changing `2d space shooter` so that you have HP (instead of dying instantly), and putting in a health bar.

## Submission
You will submit your BitBucket link through Canvas.

1. From SourceTree, create a new remote repository and point it to your local project folder. __Make sure that your repository is public__.
2. Make a `.gitignore` file in your Unity project folder. [This is a popular one](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore) that many people use.
3. Commit all your local files through Sourcetree
4. Push your staged commits to the server from Sourcetree
5. Test your submission by attempting to clone it from another machine. __If you cannot successfully clone the project and load it into Unity from another machine, then I cannot either.__
