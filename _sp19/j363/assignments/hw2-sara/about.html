                <p><em>It all started in 2012 during our senior year of college.  My name's Brad, and this is my best bro Chad. We were sitting on our porch reminiscing on the glory days at IU and how much we bonded over late night (and sometimes early breakfast) pizza. We started talking about our favorite things about each different pizza place around town.<br></br><br> As we got to talking, we realized... WHOA. What if we could take everything we loved about all of the different pizza places and combine them into one. I was like, "bruh, this could actually work." And he was like "Pizza, bruh. It's the answer." So there we sat on the front porch sharing a morning pizza from the night out before and "Pizza Bruh" was born.  We hope you love our dream as much as we love our pizza. Enjoy, bruh!</br></em></p>
