# Homework Two
## Description
After watching Omer Younas' talk, _Art Direction for AAA UI_, you should have a better understanding of how to apply graphic design principles to UI design. You will choose three principles from his talk to focus on, and gather examples/non-examples to showcase these principles. Examples should have a description or annotations, and non-examples should have a proposed solution.

### 1) Choose principles
 * Download [the slides](../mats/art-direction-for-aaa-ui.pdf)
 * Choose three principles you want to focus on _(e.g., use of fonts, anchoring UI elements, color theory)_.

### 2) Collect examples, non-examples
For each topic, you will gather at least __two examples__ and __one non-example__ (a total of six examples and three non-examples). These can be in the form of screenshots, but a video may be more appropriate if animation/interaction, or context is involved.

 * Screenshots should be relatively high resolution/quality
 * If you're linking to a YouTube video, make sure the link directs to the appropriate minute/second playback position. I should not have to watch the entire video to find the part you're showing
 * __Please avoid__ using games that were discussed in the talk unless you are exemplifying a different principle than the one he demonstrates with that game.

### 3) Provide solutions for non-examples
For each chosen non-example, propose a solution. You can either write out your solution or use an altered image/sketch/prototype to suggest a solution. Avoid vague language. Use actionable, specific language--- instead of saying _'pick better fonts'_, you might say _'swap out the serif font for a readable sans-serif font like Open Sans or Montserrat and increase font weight'_

### 4) Assemble and annotate in slideshow
 * Make a slideshow in Powerpoint/Google Slides
 * For each example given, you should either:
   * (a) put a brief description of why this screenshot is an exemplar, or...
   * (b) annotate the image by labeling important parts of it _(e.g., overlaying some rectangles on the screenshot to indicate use of Golden Section)_.
 * Your text and annotations should be descriptive but concise.
 * Be mindful of slide design; try not to put too much content on one slide.
 * You should output to a `.pdf` format.

## Submission - Canvas
Submit a `.pdf` format slideshow through Canvas.
