# Homework Three
## Description
Moving forward, you should make a decision about the technology you want to use for the rest of the semester. You should choose between [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). If you want to use another technology _(e.g. Adobe XD, Unreal Engine)_ let me know.

Considerations for your decision:
 * What you want as a portfolio piece
 * What's most useful to you long-term
 * Your level of comfort/interest in Unity. If you are definitely a non-programmer, you might opt for Figma
 * Your interest in game design--- if you're a game design major then you may find more use in Unity

Once you decide on the platform you want, you will complete a tutorial that demonstrates your knowledge of the chosen tool.

### Option One: Figma
1. Complete [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/3q3FV65ZrUs).
2. Submit a `shareable link` of your project on Canvas. You can test your share settings by attempting to open this link in an incognito window.

### Option Two: Unity
1. Complete [this tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkUSmI7F304).
2. Submit `three screenshots` that prove you've done the tutorial _(e.g., your Unity editor, your c-sharp script, etc.)_
