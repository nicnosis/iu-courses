# Homework Four: <small>Proposal</small>
# Project Four: <small>Final</small>
## Description
__Project Four__ (your final project) is meant to be an opportunity to apply all of your insights and ambitions related to game UI/UX.

__Homework Four__ is a proposal; a document that serves to convey your intention and ideas about this final project

### Final Project Criteria
My goal is to be flexible with ideas, but some possible projects are:

 * Another game prototype, similar to what we've done so far.
 * Expanding on an existing project
 * Learning a new software/technology _(e.g., learning After Effects to create interaction/motion mockups)_
 * A visual language/design system with specifications (e.g., [Google Material Design](https://material.io/)), applied to a prototype of your choice
 * A complete re-design of an existing game's UI

#### Expectations
For your final project:
 * Work should be **more polished** and observe a greater **attention to detail**
 * Work should be **substantial**: assembled with care, consistent, and without any missing or incomplete elements (e.g., no missing assets, "Lorem Ipsum" or placeholder text)
 * Work should serve as an **exemplary portfolio piece**; something that you would be proud to show a potential employer
 * Work should undergo iterations; you are expected to __take feedback and apply it__ in our remaining class time
 * Prototypes may be **static or interactive**
 * You may use existing work/assets **only with instructor's consent**.

## Proposal Requirements
For Homework Four (this proposal), you must submit:

1. A written description (_about 100-200 words_) of your project idea.
2. Answer this question--- how will I know if I have succeeded?
3. Examples/inspiration--- this can be any amount of screenshots/videos/webpages/documents that will inform your design

## Proposal Submission - Canvas
