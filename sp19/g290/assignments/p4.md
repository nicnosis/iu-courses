# Project Four `15 pts.`
## Description
By now, you should have an idea of what you want to do for your final project. You can expand on an existing project, develop a new one, or collaborate with others.

## Considerations for Grading
This project should:

 * Apply principles you've learned in class
 * Prove challenging to you
 * Force you into new/uncomfortable territory as a designer
 * Be extensible in nature--- you can easily build off of it, share with others, or adapt for future use.
 * Be prepared as a portfolio piece

### Submission and Deliverables
This will be specific to your project, but please submit in such a way that:

 * It is easy for me to access your files/project
 * Files are named sensibly (if I download a batch of projects, I should know which one is yours)

#### **Due Tuesday December 11th at 11:59pm**
#### Remember that because this is the final project, `late submissions are not accepted`
