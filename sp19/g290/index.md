### At Home
 * `complete` [Homework One](assignments/hw1.html). It is due `Wednesday January 16th @ 11:59pm`

## week 3
This week, you will continue working on [Project One](assignments/p1.html). The due date has been extended to `Friday Feb 1st @ 11:59pm`

Considerations for Project One:
 * You are not expected to reproduce art assets at a professional level of detail
 * Be mindful of the time frame you have--- you may have to cut down your project to something smaller and more manageable
 * This project is largely exploratory in nature--- you are being exposed to new tools and methods and it takes time to implement them properly
 * In general for Projects, you will either produce (a) greater quantity of content at lower detail or (b) smaller quantity of content at higher detail. Keep this in mind when considering the scope of your project.

## week 4
Continue working on [Project One](assignments/p1.html). By now, you should be committed to an idea and in the processing of executing it. Remember to review the deliverables for this assignments _(e.g., taking screenshots of your process)_

It is due `Friday Feb 8th @ 11:59pm`

## week 5
Use this week to finish out [Project One](assignments/p1.html).

After careful consideration, I have extended the due date (again). It is due `Friday Feb 8th @ 11:59pm`

I will use class time Monday and Wednesday to meet with students individually. Because this section is much larger than previous semesters, I will have to split students into two groups.

__Please come prepared for your scheduled timeslot__. You will only need to attend __one day this week__. __PLEASE ONLY ATTEND THE DAY YOU ARE SCHEDULED__; work from home and e-mail with any questions.
