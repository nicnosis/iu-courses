### In Class

#### Wednesday
 * `discussion`: Defining success
 * `participation`: Canvas response
 * `continue` [Project Three](assignments/p3.html). It is due `Sunday April 7th at 11:59pm`

Some thoughts for this project:

 * Prioritize tasks in order of importance. Focus on getting the site layout and aesthetics down before small details.
 * Make use of tutorials. [Webflow University](https://university.webflow.com/) is massive and has solutions for most issues.
 * Don't get discouraged if your site doesn't come out exactly as you envisioned; Webflow has a learning curve and you shouldn't expect your first project to be 100% perfect.
 * Remember that setbacks, roadblocks, and hurdles are all part of the process of creating. Embrace these as part of the process _(easier said than done, I know)_
 * Above all, have fun with the project and make it into something that will serve you in the future
