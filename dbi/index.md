## week 9
Welcome to `DBI`! This course website will keep all of your assignments. I divide tasks into those completed `in class` and those completed `at home`.

The only thing you need Canvas for is submitting completed assignments.

### in class
 * `introductions` - Who are you and why are you here?
 * `group exercise` - Defining _brand_, _design_, and _identity_.

### at home
 * `complete` the [pre-test](https://goo.gl/forms/PRKnj0wKiQ3LukaT2)
