## week 9
Welcome to `DBI`! This course website will keep all of your assignments. I divide tasks into those completed `in class` and those completed `at home`.

The only thing you need Canvas for is submitting completed assignments.

### in class
 * `introductions` - Who are you and why are you here?
 * `group exercise` - Defining _brand_, _design_, and _identity_.
 * `discussion` - Coca-cola, Starbucks, and Nike

### at home
 * `complete` the [pre-test](https://goo.gl/forms/PRKnj0wKiQ3LukaT2)
 * `read` the [syllabus](dbi-syllabus.pdf)
 * `complete` [HW1 - words and images](assignments/dbi-hw1.pdf) - Paper submission (you will see your grade on Canvas later)

## week 10
