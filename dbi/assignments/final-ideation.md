# Homework Three--- Final Ideation
## Description
For `Homework Three`, you will generate an idea for your final and then form a plan to execute it.

Your `final project` involves putting a presentation together for a branded, visual story. This will usually be in the form of a slide-based _(e.g., PowerPoint)_ presentation. However, you are free to make a video, website, or other visually-engaging form of presentation.

The goal is to show that you can (1) conceive of a brand identity and (2) represent it visually.

__You may work alone or in groups, but I have a greater expectation of quality and content from group projects.__

## Requirements
My goal is that, come Tuesday, you will have a solid understanding of what your final project is.

### 1) Your Idea
You will come up with a fictional product--- a product, service, app, restaurant, or anything else that can be branded.

Some of you already have ideas; you are free to use the ideas from earlier assignments or in-class exercises.

### 2) Inspiration
You will provide __at least three examples__ of products you wish to emulate. For example, if you are inventing a bakery, you might give me links to [this](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/238690848981730935/) and [this](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/499477414908239268/).

#### Sources of inspiration

 * Behance--- [Advertising gallery](https://www.behance.net/galleries/9/Advertising?tracking_source=title)

### 3) Mockups
You will need to have some form of `visual mockup` for your product. The goal is to have a realistic looking visual representation of the product.

Mockups can be found for all kinds of products--- business cards, iPhone apps, t-shirts and sweaters, packaging, bottled drinks, logo designs, and so on.

You will provide links to __at least three__ visual mockups you plan to use in your final.

#### Sources for mockups
You may use free or paid mockups. __It's worth purchasing a mockup package__ from somewhere like [envato elements](https://elements.envato.com); this will greatly improve the quality of your work and cut down on the time that it takes you.

#### A note on attribution
__Please be aware__ that for many of these mockups, you are required to credit the source in some way; you should make note of exactly where you got the mockup files from so that you can give credit when you present.

### 4) Details

 * What is the format of your presentation? Slideshow? Video? Website?
