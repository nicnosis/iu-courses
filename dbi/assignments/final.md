# Project Three
## Description


## Submission
There are two things I need from you.

1. A canvas submission (So I have your files)
2. An in-class presentation

### Canvas Submission
Upload your files in a `.zip` file named `final_lastname-firstname.zip`

Submit to:  
`CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > PROJECT THREE`

### Presentation
You will present your final project in class on **Monday Dec 11th at 7:15pm**.

These are informal presentations; any format is fine.
