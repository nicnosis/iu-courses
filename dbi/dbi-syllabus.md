Grading criteria will be given for each individual assignment.

## Revisions  
Students are __sometimes__ allowed to revise and resubmit assignments. Re-submitting work is a __privilege__ granted at the instructor's discretion.

If you are re-submitting work:

1. You must have submitted the work by its due date. Late work is not eligible for re-submission.
2. The privilege to revise submitted work is only available for students who submitted substantial work; incomplete or dysfunctional code is not eligible for resubmission. This is at the instructor's discretion.
3. You may only recover partial points lost.


### Software
You will need access to Adobe Creative Cloud.

### Hardware
While web development can be done from any operating system, the instructor teaches workflow for OS X users. Access to a computer with Mac OS X is recommended but not required. All students should have access to a Mac through the computer lab. Students who aren't using OS X are expected to learn PC keyboard shortcuts and find Windows-compatible substitutes for software.

It is also useful to have access to a large display, or dual display configuration. If you are bringing your own laptop to class, it is recommended to bring a mouse.

## Policies

### Attendance
Students should make a serious effort to attend every lecture. While attendance is not taken, I believe **attendance is the strongest guarantor of success** in this course.

Course material is cumulative in nature and class periods are used to develop programming skills and work on projects. You will also miss out on quizzes and participation activities if you miss class.

### Lost Data
You are responsible for keeping backups/duplicates of your files. As an IU student, you should have access to a Box account. You can also use Google Drive or GitHub to maintain copies of your files. Losing your files is not an excuse for late or incomplete work.

I **highly recommend** getting a [Box](https://uits.iu.edu/box) account. It is free, helps you to stay organized, and most importantly provides **backups** for your files.

### Food and Drink in Class
Sorry, they are not permitted.

### Deadlines
Deadlines are strict and non-negotiable. Late assignments will be accepted for the first five calendar days after a deadline. After that, I will remove 10% daily. Assignments may not be submitted after five calendar days have elapsed (Example - Deadline is September 8th, you cannot submit after September 13th)

The only __exception to this rule__ is the final project, which cannot be submitted late.

### Students with Disabilities
If any student requires assistance or academic accommodations for a disability, please contact me by after class, by e-mail, or during office hours. The student must have established eligibility for disability support services through the Office of Disability Services for Students.

### Academic Integrity
As a student at IU, you are expected to adhere to the standards and policies detailed in the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct (Code). When you submit an assignment with your name on it, you are signifying that the work contained therein is yours, unless otherwise cited or referenced. Any ideas or materials taken from another source for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. All suspected violations of the Code will be reported to the Dean of Students and handled according to University policies. Sanctions for academic misconduct may include a failing grade on the assignment, reduction in your final course grade, and a failing grade in the course, among other possibilities. If you are unsure about the expectations for completing an assignment or taking a test or exam, be sure to seek clarification beforehand.

#### Proper Attribution for Referenced Works
By nature, code is re-usable and extensible. It is both acceptable and encouraged to utilize and adapt examples of code; this is common on websites like StackOverflow. However, the sources for all referenced code must be given in your code commenting. I will assist students with finding code that is reusable (such as under the GNU license), and help with giving proper credit to the source.

### Sexual Misconduct
As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to create a positive learning environment for all students. Title IX and IU’s Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibit sexual misconduct in any form, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and domestic violence.  If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone who has, the University can help.
If you are seeking help and would like to speak to someone confidentially, you can make an appointment with:

 * The Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS) at (812) 855-8900 (counseling services)
 * Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at (812) 856-2469 (advocacy and advice services)
 * IU Health Center at (812) 855-4011 (health and medical services)

It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct, with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU’s Title IX Coordinator.  In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available.   Protecting student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist. 
I encourage you to visit stopsexualviolence.iu.edu to learn more.


### Religious Holidays 

*It is the policy of Indiana University that instructors must reasonably accommodate students who want to observe their religious holidays at times when academic requirements conflict with those observances. This policy is intended to ensure that both faculty and students are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in the accommodation of students' religious observances.*

### Syllabus
This course is rich in content and skill levels vary widely among students. The instructor reserves the right to amend this syllabus to better match the needs of a given class.

### Final Grade
The instructor reserves the right to adjust your final grade based on effort and participation. This is very uncommon.

## Tentative Schedule
A given class of students can differ widely in skills and teaching needs, so schedule is subject to change.
