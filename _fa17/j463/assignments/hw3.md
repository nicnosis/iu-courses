# Homework Three - <small>Flat Design</small>
## Description
For Homework Three, you will use Illustrator to create [flat design](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=flat+design) artwork. Though simplistic in appearance, flat design is an elegant and effective approach to making graphics.

## Approach
You can create anything you'd like, but I highly recommend following one of these two tutorials:

  <div class="card-block">
    <h4 class="card-title">Tutorial: Meteor</h4>
    <img src="img/hw2-tut1.png" alt="tutorial one" class="img-thumbnail">
    <div class="spacer-1rem"></div>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/IsbeqtIIt7I" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">View Tutorial</a>
  </div>

 <div class="card-block">
    <h4 class="card-title">Tutorial: Tree</h4>
    <img src="img/hw2-tut2.png" alt="tutorial one" class="img-thumbnail">
    <div class="spacer-1rem"></div>
    <a href="https://youtu.be/qi-HKHgP9rA" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">View Tutorial</a>
  </div>
