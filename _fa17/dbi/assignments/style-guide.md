# Project Two--- Personal Brand Style Guide
## Description
You will create a style guide for your personal brand. This guide is intended to serve you in your career path; it will help you make design decisions based on your values, beliefs, and goals.

In completing this style guide, you will understand yourself better and work towards creating a marketable identity.

You will be able to ask yourself questions like this:

1. "Is my personal brand distinct and memorable?"
2. "Does my portfolio really embody my personal brand?"
3. "Is my branding consistent across my work?"
4. "Do I have a good sense of my strengths?"
