# Homework Two--- Logo Interpretation
## Description
I will give you a set of abstract shapes/symbols. __Pick one of them__ and use it as a basis for a logo.

The goal of this exercise is to see if you can transform an abstract visual element, with no meaning, into a meaningful logo.

I want you to feel more creatively empowered, more comfortable taking risks, and more open to finding inspiration anywhere and everywhere.

## Getting started
First, download this:

  <div class="card-block">
    <h4 class="card-title">logo-starter.pdf</h4>
    <!--<p class="card-text">Click below to download</p>-->
    <a href="../mats/logo-starter.pdf" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">Download</a>
  </div>

1. Try to envision a brand/idea first (existing or imagined). Is this an air travel company? A record studio? A natural food market?
2. Use the shape as a basis for the logo concept
3. Generate __at least two__ ideas.

## Approach
1. Pick a shape, then get inspiration from existing logos.
2. On a piece of paper or sketchbook, draw out ideas until you have a concept you like.
3. Use Illustrator or another tool to create your final work.

### Get inspired
It often helps to find existing logos as inspiration.

I recommend checking some of these:

 * [Behance](https://www.behance.net/search?&search=logo) --- Search either 'logo' or view the 'branding' category for ideas.
 * [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=logo) --- Creating an idea board is also helpful.
 * [Logodesignlove](https://www.logodesignlove.com/) --- Also buy this book if you are serious about brand identity.
 * [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/search?q=logo) --- Search 'logo' or 'branding'

### Iterate
I recommend drawing/doodling until you find a concept that works. There is no magic number, but you might want to sketch out 20-50 ideas and pick the best one.

### Deliver
After you have your concept, use Illustrator or another tool to create two (or more) logos.

## Requirements
### Interpretation
You are free to change or reimagine the symbol as long as I can tell what you started with. This project is open to loose interpretation; it is a creative endeavor.

You can add additional elements/shapes if you like, and text if it is helpful.

### Iterations
You must submit __at least two__ ideas. They can be very similar.

You might try:

1. Variations on color
2. Variations on size/position of elements
3. Adding text; varying font;
4. Mirroring your logo horizontally or vertically

### Format
You may work however you like, but your submission should be an `image file` or a `pdf`.

You can:

1. Draw with pencil/pen and scan
2. Draw in Illustrator
3. Use any other creative tool


## Submission
Remember that you must have __at least two ideas__.

`CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > HOMEWORK TWO`

1. An image file. `.png` is preferred.
2. A `.pdf` file.

### Due Date
