## week 10
### In Class

You will create an interactive prototype for a hero collection/card collection game.

1. Come up with a list of examples _(e.g., Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links, Fire Emblem Heroes, Hearthstone)_.
2. Collect screenshots from the list of examples.
3. Look at exemplary UIs. I recommend looking at the [UI Field on Behance](https://www.behance.net/search?field=132&content=projects&sort=featured_date&time=week&featured_on_behance=true)
4. Start a Figma project
5. Create screens for your game
6. Pay attention to visual treatment. Try to use a consistent style of colors, fonts, iconography, and maintain the same general look/feel between screens.
7. Submit progress when finished. __Make sure everybody's name is on it somewhere__.

Since you may have a lot of repeating components _(e.g., grid of cards)_, you might find these articles useful:
 * [Components in Figma](https://blog.figma.com/components-in-figma-e7e80fcf6fd2)
 * [Component Architecture in Figma](https://blog.figma.com/component-architecture-in-figma-f16ae9cc4481)
