## week 12
We will be working on Project Three in class this week and next week. Make sure you have a way to access your project (e.g., keeping it on Box). Please do not show up to class without your project to work on.

### In Class
#### Monday
 * `install` [MOPS](https://www.motionoperators.com/).
   * Go to the [Github download page](https://github.com/toadstorm/MOPS)
 * `download` [mats/MOPS_example.hipnc](MOPS_example.hipnc)

 * `inspirations`: Project Three
   * [Behance search '3d abstract'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&search=3d%20abstract&sort=appreciations&time=week)
   * [Behance search 'houdini'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&tools=28119&sort=featured_date&time=week)
   * [Behance search 'sculpting'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&field=sculpting&sort=featured_date&time=week)
   * [Behance search 'motion design'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&field=motion%20graphics&sort=featured_date&time=week)
   * [Pinterest search '3d abstract'](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=3d+abstract)
   * [Pinterest search 'abstract geometric'](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=abstract+geometric)

You will create a `stylescape` for Project Three, due before class Wednesday.

#### Wednesday
(1) Mops: Review installation
 * First, start Houdini. This will create the `houdini17.5` folder inside of Documents
 * Download and unzip your MOPS folders. You should have a folder called `MOPS` and `packages`. Put these two inside of the `houdini17.5` folder.
 * If you weren't here, download [MOPS-install.zip](mats/MOPS-install.zip). You will have to edit `packages/MOPS.json` and change the path to match the path on your machine.
 * You may have to restart Houdini for this to work.

(2) Stylescapes:
 * We will review your stylescapes and find the next step forward for you.

(3) Practice:
 * If time permits, we will continue with MOPS.
 
#### Reminders
 1. Make sure you are clear on how to install/use MOPS. You don't necessarily need MOPS for Project Three but it is quite helpful. Keep your two MOPS folders backed up online somewhere so we can use them every time.
 2. Instead of working on an individual `.hipnc` file, you want to set up a project folder in Houdini and use that. This is where you will put your HDRI (environment light).
 3. Make sure you are maintaining a backup of your project, that you can access from any computer. I recommend using [Box@IU](https://uits.iu.edu/box)
 4. Try to have fun and enjoy the project. I know schoolwork can be taxing but art can prove very therapeutic and relaxing if done with the right mindset.

### At Home
 * `begin` [Project Three](assignments/p3.html). It is due `Saturday, November 23rd` @ 11:59pm
 * `watch` [MOPS Tutorials](https://vimeo.com/motionoperators). I recommend doing a few of these videos a day
 
## week 13
### In class
#### Monday
Review:
 * Houdini project folder
   * Make sure you have a `render` folder. I will look here for your renders.
   * Make sure your HDRI (environment light) is in the project folder.
 * How to apply materials
   * Create/import material from the `material palette`
   * Go to the `obj` level and select your geometry
   * On the `parameters` pane, go to `render` tab and set the material
 * How to render
   * Set up a camera if you don't have one
   * If you want your HDRI background visible, select the environment light object at `obj` level and make sure `Render Light Geometry` is checked under `Light` tab in `parameters`.
   * Use `Render > Preview in MPlay`
   * You can select your mantra renderer in the `out` level of network view to change settings
   * Save a frame to your `render` folder
   * You will submit a rendered frame for today's `participation`
   
#### Wednesday
Remember you need to use some VEX in your project, somewhere.
 * `download` [mops_vex.hipnc](mats/mops_vex.hipnc)
 * [This article on scale randomization](https://houdinitricks.com/different-ways-to-randomize-scale-in-houdini/) might give some good ideas
 * [The Joy of Vex](http://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=JoyOfVex) is a good introduction.
 * `participation`: Give me a brief overview of how you intend to use VEX. Remember that it does not need to be intricate or complicated.

### At Home
 * `complete` [Project Three](assignments/p3.html). It is due `Saturday, November 23rd` @ 11:59pm

## Week 14
__Announcement__: There will be no HW4, just Project Four (which will be worth 25 points instead of 20). This is to give you a little more time to work on the Project.

### In Class
#### Monday
 * `download`: [narrative-examples.zip](mats/narrative-examples.zip)
 
__QUESTIONS__  
Response:
 * What does it remind you of?

#### Wednesday
__GROUP SHARE__  
Discuss:
 * `Idea generation`; (this reminds me of ___; when you say ___ it makes me think of ____)

   * Do the examples from the stylescape reflect the theme?
   * Is it cohesive? Does the imagery in the stylescape feel like it goes together?
 * `Composition`: How might the artist organize this work?
 * `Writing`: Remember that the project includes a small amount of writing. What writing might be helpful to supplement the artist's message?
 * `Implementation`: How might the artist use Houdini __(or another tool)__ to create the work?

### At Home
