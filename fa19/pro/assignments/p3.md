# Project Three `15 pts.`
## Description
In this assignment, you will use Houdini to create an abstract piece that introduces randomization.

Before you do anything, I recommend going through [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/mVim6iPEFGY) at least twice.

### Need inspiration?
You can search by Houdini Projects on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&tools=28119&sort=featured_date&time=week)



## Requirements
### VISION `7 pts.`
Message and Meaning
 * Project conveys artistic ambition
 * Project has a clear theme, purpose, vision, idea, statement, message, etc.
 * Project is dynamic, captivating, noteworthy, thought-provoking, etc.

Aesthetic
 * Project is pleasant and presentable. Should be usable as a portfolio piece.
 * Project either `(a)` has representational merit (looks like something familiar) or `(b)` is appealing as an abstract work 
 * Colors and visual effects should be harmonious and deliberate
 * Precision and care
 * Effort is made to make sure shapes look good
 * This might mean subdividing elements to smooth them out, add a smooth node... converting to VDB etc.

### RENDERING `3 pts.`
Renders:
 * Successfully render three frames (use `.png` please)

Lighting:
 * Contains environment lighting with an HDRI. You can get them from [HDRIHaven](https://hdrihaven.com/)

Materials:
 * Geometry has some kind of material
 
### VARIATION `3 pts.`

Randomization:
 * Project implements some form of randomization
 * You may find [this article](https://houdinitricks.com/different-ways-to-randomize-scale-in-houdini/) useful.
 * Project should give me a way to experiment with variation. I recommend using a channel to do this (add one to your parameter interface). You can read about it [here](http://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=JoyOfVex2)
 * Scatter node is a good way to create variation.
 * Switch node is also useful in introducing variation.

Loops:
 * You need some kind of loop
 * You can use the loop for __any reason__ but it shouldn't be for __no reason__.
 * Excellent [loop tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ermCiovKIY&t=1098s) here.
 * [Another one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs5WezgOZlo&list=PLluEQHH-SaesqNqByvAzI63_txp5n2lW6&index=8&t=0s)
 

### VEX `2 pts.`
 * Project must have some form of VEX code (it can even be one line of code)
 * You may find [JoyOfVex](http://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=JoyOfVex) useful.
