# Project Four `25 pts.`
## Description
This project is similar to the last one, except with a much greater focus on:

1. Having a narrative or message conveyed through your art
2. A unifying sense of composition

That is to say--- you will use the same technical skills, but focus on a narrative or theme. Instead of putting together a few random renders, you will organize your renders into some kind of meaningful composition.

### Narrative Examples
 * [Disctortion](https://www.behance.net/gallery/86478307/Disctortion?tracking_source=search-all%7Cabstract%20art) 
 * [Zerospace](https://zerospace.co/)
 * [Wassily Kandinsky](https://gbtimes.com/abstract-narrative)
 * [MAGMA - A tale of destruction and regrowth](https://www.behance.net/gallery/80058971/Magma?tracking_source=search-all%7Cabstract%20art)
 * Here is a [useful article](https://www.art-mine.com/collectorscorner/understanding-abstract-art/) on interpretation of abstract art

### Recommended Format: Triptych
A [triptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych) is recommended but I am flexible about the format you choose.

[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?autologin=true&q=triptych) has some good examples of triptychs.

[Here's a great example](https://www.behance.net/gallery/47200469/Triptych?tracking_source=search-all%7Ctriptych) of abstract art in triptych form.

One way to accomplish this is to (1) render your three images and then (2) arrange them in Illustrator or Photoshop.

### Need inspiration?
This list is not exhaustive but it's a good starting point. You are welcome to draw inspiration from everything (even if it's not related to art, graphics, design, etc.)

   * [Pinterest search 'abstract geometric'](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=abstract+geometric)

## Requirements
### VISION `10 pts`
Message and Meaning
 * Project conveys artistic ambition
 * Project has a clear theme, purpose, vision, idea, statement, message, etc.
 * Project is dynamic, captivating, noteworthy, thought-provoking, etc.

### APPEARANCE (individual panels) `5 pts.`
Take your time with renders; make sure to experiment with lighting, materials, and camera angles to achieve nice-looking renders.

### COMPOSITION `5 pts.`
Work should be arranged in a meaningful way.

Examples of how you might present your work:
1. Single PNG with panels arranged as triptych
2. Powerpoint deck that has writing (e.g. poetry accompanied with images)
3. Website with writing and imagery

### WRITING `5 pts.`
You should have a small amount of text that tells me what the theme or narrative is. You can have this as a separate file (perhaps a `.pdf`) or directly on the composition itself.

Also be clear about what you want me to look at when I'm grading.

## Submission
You can submit in either (a) a `.zip` file or (b) a URL

1. Make sure your Houdini project folder is named `p4-lastname-firstname`
2. Compress your Houdini project folder. Make sure all of the relevant assets (e.g. HDRI) are in the folder.
3. If it's not obvious, let me know which file(s) you want me to look at when grading
2. Submit the `.zip` file to Canvas

It is due `Friday, Dec 20th` @ 11:59pm
### `Since this is the final project, LATE SUBMISSIONS ARE NOT ACCEPTED.`
