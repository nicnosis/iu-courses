# Project Two --- <small>Interface Control</small>
## Description
In this assignment, you will use p5.js to create an interactive art piece that implements the following:

 1. [dat.GUI](https://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage) or another form of user interface
 2. objects
 3. arrays
 4. looping/iteration _(e.g. using a 'for' loop)_
 
 A great way to satisfy the last three requirements is to define an object you'd like, populate an array, and use loops to traverse (iterate through) the array.

## Details
This project is worth `10 points`.

`2 pts.` Visual aesthetic:
 * Project is pleasant and presentable. Should be usable as a portfolio piece.
 * Project has a clear vision, theme, or intention behind it
 * Project either `(a)` has representational merit (looks like something familiar) or `(b)` is appealing as an abstract work 
 * Project is dynamic, captivating, or thought-provoking
 * Colors and visual effects should be harmonious and deliberate
 
`2 pts.` Drawing basics:
 * Project must include some form of 'primitives' such as `line()`, `rect()`, `ellipse()`, `point()`, etc.
 * Project must use at least one of: `fill()`, `stroke()`, or `background()`
 * Student understands `p5.js` coordinate system _(e.g. using environment variables like `width` and `height` where appropriate)_

`2 pts.` Programming principles:
 * Code must make use of user-defined variables; e.g. `var xPos = 10;`
 * Code must make use of conditional logic; e.g. `if(xPos >= width/2) { ... }`

`2 pts.` Interactivity:
 * Project includes some form of keyboard input.
 * Project includes some form of mouse input.
 * You may find the [interactivity](https://p5js.org/learn/interactivity.html) tutorial on learn p5 useful
 * You may also find the [events section of the docs](https://p5js.org/reference/#group-Events) useful

`2 pt.` Code quality:
 * Code adheres to [JavaScript coding conventions and style guide](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp)
 * Code is clean and readable
 * Code is blocked out into meaningful sections
 * Code is free of unnecessary line returns/whitespace
 * Identifiers _(e.g. variable names)_ are meaningful
 * Code contains useful comments
 * Code is optimized; use loops instead of repeating the same function five times in a row. Use objects when a similar construct is repeated. Use arrays to keep data of the same type.
 * No unnecessary/dysfunctional code (e.g. putting `fill('blue')` a bunch of times when you only need to set it once)


### Do not steal code
You can reference stuff from the docs, of course. For instance you might use some of the starter code from an example and put a comment that says:

```js
 // adapted from https://p5js.org/examples/math-random.html
```
