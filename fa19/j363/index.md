#### Stylescapes
We will work in groups to refine our stylescapes.

Questions for discussion:
 * __VISUAL COHESION__: Do the images/elements in the stylescape have a consistent look and feel? Do they look like they belong together? Are there images/elements that do not belong?
 *  __DESCRIPTOR WORDS__: Do the three chosen words describe the personality of the brand? _(Remember: these words should describe the brand, not the product)_
 * __ACTION__: Given the stylescape and the sketch, is it clear how you might go about building out the website?
 
 * `submit` your participation response on Canvas
