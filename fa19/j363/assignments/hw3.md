## Description
You will make a simple, three-column responsive layout using Webflow.

1. First watch [this video](https://youtu.be/pirYjigdIu0) for an explanation
2. Then download [these assets you will need](start/hw3-assets.zip)
3. Then go to [Webflow University](https://university.webflow.com/courses/webflow-101-crash-course) to learn how to use it.

If you have issues publishing, you can also export the code, set up the project in Atom, and compress the project folder to submit it (you may want to double-check your submission with me or the teaching assistant).
