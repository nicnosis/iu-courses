# Project Three `15 pts.`
## Description
In this assignment, you will use Houdini to create an abstract piece that introduces randomization.

Before you do anything, I recommend going through [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/mVim6iPEFGY) at least twice.

### Need inspiration?
This list is not exhaustive but it's a good starting point. You are welcome to draw inspiration from everything (even if it's not related to art, graphics, design, etc.)

   * [Behance search '3d abstract'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&search=3d%20abstract&sort=appreciations&time=week)
   * [Behance search 'houdini'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&tools=28119&sort=featured_date&time=week)
   * [Behance search 'sculpting'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&field=sculpting&sort=featured_date&time=week)
   * [Behance search 'motion design'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&field=motion%20graphics&sort=featured_date&time=week)
   * [Pinterest search '3d abstract'](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=3d+abstract)
   * [Pinterest search 'abstract geometric'](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=abstract+geometric)

## Requirements
### VISION `7 pts.`
Message and Meaning
 * Project conveys artistic ambition
 * Project has a clear theme, purpose, vision, idea, statement, message, etc.
 * Project is dynamic, captivating, noteworthy, thought-provoking, etc.

Aesthetic
 * Project is pleasant and presentable. Should be usable as a portfolio piece.
 * Project should be appealing as an abstract work 
 * Colors and visual effects should be harmonious and deliberate
 * There is a sense of precision and care; effort is made to make sure shapes look good
 * This might mean subdividing elements to smooth them out, add a smooth node... converting to VDB etc.

### RENDERING `3 pts.`
Renders:
 * When you are ready to render, use `Render > Preview in MPlay`. Then you can save the frame from there.
 * Successfully render at least three frames (use `.png` please).
 * Put them in the `render` folder.

Lighting:
 * Contains environment lighting with an HDRI. You can get them from [HDRIHaven](https://hdrihaven.com/)
 * __MAKE SURE YOUR HDRI FILE IS IN THE PROJECT FOLDER__

Materials:
 * Geometry has some kind of material
 * You can select a pre-made material from the `material palette` to add to your project.
 * At the `obj` level you can select your geometry, go to `parameters` and set the material in the `render` tab.
 
### VARIATION `3 pts.`
Randomization:
 * Project implements some form of randomization
 * You may find [this article](https://houdinitricks.com/different-ways-to-randomize-scale-in-houdini/) useful. _(This is also a great way to add some VEX to your project)_
 * Project should give me a way to experiment with variation. I recommend using a channel to do this (add one to your parameter interface). You can read about it [here](http://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=JoyOfVex2)
 * Scatter node is a good way to create variation.
 * Switch node is also useful in introducing variation.

Loops:
 * <s>You need some kind of loop</s> `EDIT: Loops are optional`.
 * You can use the loop for __any reason__ but it shouldn't be for __no reason__.
 * Excellent [loop tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ermCiovKIY&t=1098s) here.
 * [Another one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs5WezgOZlo&list=PLluEQHH-SaesqNqByvAzI63_txp5n2lW6&index=8&t=0s)

### VEX `2 pts.`
 * Project must have some form of VEX code (it can even be one line of code)
 * You may find [JoyOfVex](http://www.tokeru.com/cgwiki/index.php?title=JoyOfVex) useful.

## Submission
This time instead of just submitting the `.hipnc` file, you will submit the entire project folder, compressed as a `.zip` file.

1. Compress your Houdini project folder. Make sure all of the relevant assets (e.g. HDRI) are in the folder.
2. Make sure you have a `render` folder with your renderings in it.
2. Submit the `.zip` file to Canvas

It is due `Saturday, November 23rd` @ 11:59pm
