# Inspiration

## A note
While this list is fairly exhaustive, I cannot understate the importance of exploring different sources and mediums.

 * Can you get website ideas from reading a graphic novel?
 * Can you get motion design ideas from birdwatching?
 * Can you get visual style or branding ideas from watching a music video?

__Absolutely.__

Never limit yourself to conventional sources or immerse yourself in an echo chamber; the most novel ideas can manifest in unlikely places.
