Review this checklist to ensure you understand the concepts covered. You are encouraged to ask for clarification, review, or examples for anything that has been covered so far - I am happy to do in-class demonstrations.

## MarkDown
You may recall that Markdown is a language used to generate HTML.  
For instance, using this syntax in Markdown:

~~~markdown
# This is an h1
## This is an h2

[IU](http://iu.edu)
~~~

Will give you this HTML:

~~~html
<h1>This is an h1</h1>
<h2>This is an h2</h2>

<a href="http://iu.edu">IU</a>
~~~
Before you proceed:

* Have you installed [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) for SublimeText?
* Do you have Markdown Preview installed?
* Do you know how to create, open, and edit a Markdown (.md) file in SublimeText?
* Do you know how to use Markdown Preview to save a `.md` file as a `.html` file?


## HTML
Make sure you understand the difference between the `<head>` and `<body>` of an HTML document. The head is loaded first, and contains vital information to the browser such as where to look for CSS rules. The body contains the structure of the website; the visual elements you see on a page correspond to elements (_tags_) in the body of an HTML file.

We only have a few uses for the `<head>` tag so far:

### Head
* Do you know how to use the `<link>` tag to link a stylesheet (_CSS file_)?
* Do you know how to import a font from Google Fonts?
* Do you know how to change the `<title>` of your webpage?

### Body
The `<body>` is made up tags, generally enclosed in angle brackets: `<tagname>`  
Make sure you are comfortable using these tags, and have a good understand of their uses:

* h1, h2, h3...
* p
* ul, li _(unordered lists; list items)_
* br _(line break)_
* div
* a _(link)_
* img

Also ensure that you know how to assign a class to an HTML element, and that you are comfortable using Chrome's 'inspect' tool.
