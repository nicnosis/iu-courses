## Description
Web design has a profound impact on our everyday experiences of work, recreation, and communication. This course focuses on developing practical, marketable skills for front-end web development. Fundamentally, this course focuses on **experience** and **design** as they relate to web development; technical details and coding are secondary. The Internet is constantly evolving - sometimes in a way that is seemingly unpredictable and erratic. Upon completion of this course, students will have a strong foundation of the technical and design skills necessary to produce pleasant web experiences, and the skills to adapt to a constantly-changing medium.

## Work
### Use of Class Time
This class is project-driven, and demands consistent effort inside and outside of the classroom. Classes are intended to be variable and may feature lectures, tutorials, in-class exercises, discussions and lab time. An effort is made to create a more interactive and less passive experience for students.


### Projects
This class features three large-scale web design projects, one of which will be your final website.

#### Project 1 - HTML Tags and Attributes
Students will construct a basic website outline using HTML. This project assesses students' knowledge of HTML tags and basic site structure. Project 1 aims to familiarize students with their text editors and development tools.

#### Project 2 - Styling and CSS
The focus of Project 2 is CSS. Students will demonstrate their ability to add visual elements and style to sites. Project 2 will test students' knowledge of CSS selectors, properties, and values, as well as the Box-Model. 

#### Final Project - Bootstrap Site
You will design, prototype, and develop a multi-page website using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). This project is designed to combine all of the skills you've acquired throughout the semester.

### Homework
This class has __four__ homework assignments designed to test and reinforce knowledge from class. Homework assignments will typically involve a shorter or less involved coding task.

#### Codecademy
You will be given assignments to complete on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css/). In order to really learn and memorize code, you need to practice. While the Codecademy assignments are not graded, completing them will make your homeworks, projects, and quizzes much easier.

### Quizzes
This course will feature __four__ unannounced quizzes. The quizzes should be fairly simple if you have been reading the textbook and following lectures.

### Participation
Participation is an important element of this class. It is not enough to read about web design and its constituent languages; one must actively practice and hone their skills to be successful. Many of our classes will focus on the completion of certain exercises, tutorials, and discussions. __Ten__ of these small exercises will be given throughout the semester. They are to be finished during class and are generally graded on completion.

### Final
There is no final exam for this class. Instead, you will submit your final project by the end of the semester.


## Grade

There are a total of **100** points in this class. 

The grade is divided as follows:

| Assignment                     |  Points |
|:-------------------------------|--------:|
| Project 1                      |      10 |
| Project 2                      |      15 |
| Final Project                  |      30 |
| Homeworks (4 @ 5 pts each)     |      20 |
| Quizzes (5 @ 3 pts each)       |      15 |
| Participation (10 @ 1 pt each) |      10 |
| **Total**                      | **100** |

Your grade will be assigned as follows:

| Points       | Grade |
|:-------------|:------|
| 93 - 100     | A     |
| 90 - 92      | A-    |
| 87 - 89      | B+    |
| 84 - 86      | B     |
| 80 - 83      | B-    |
| 77 - 79      | C+    |
| 74 - 76      | C     |
| 70 - 73      | C-    |
| 67 - 69      | D+    |
| 60 - 66      | D     |
| 59 and below | F     |

Grading criteria will be given for each individual assignment.

## Revisions  
When software is created in a professional environment, changes and revisions are common. Factoring that web development is an iterative process, students are __sometimes__ allowed to revise and resubmit assignments. Re-submitting work is a __privilege__ granted at the instructor's discretion.

If you are re-submitting work:
1. You must have submitted the work by its due date. Late work is not eligible for re-submission
2. The privilege to revise submitted work is only available for students who submitted substantial work; incomplete or dysfunctional code is not eligible for resubmission. This is at the instructor's discretion.
3. You may only recover partial points lost.



## Required Readings and Materials
### Text
We will use [HTML and CSS: Visual QuickStart Guide ](http://a.co/gwPoEWG), _8th edition_ by Elizabeth Castro et al. You are welcome to use any book you like, but assignments and projects will be tailored to the contents of this textbook.

### Codecademy
You will use [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css/), a free online learning environment, to practice your coding skills outside of class.

### Software
Software is a focal point of this course, and an effort was made to ensure that free, cross-platform software will be used wherever possible. Tools, applications, and services prove invaluable in web development.

We will use:  

 1. A text editor - [Atom]() is recommended.  
 2. A means of version control - [Box](https://uits.iu.edu/box) is recommended. Google Drive and Dropbox are good alternatives. **Lost data is not an excuse for late or missing work**, so it is extremely important to have duplicate files for your work.

### Hardware
While web development can be done from any operating system, the instructor teaches workflow for OS X users. Access to a computer with Mac OS X is recommended but not required. All students should have access to a Mac through the computer lab. Students who aren't using OS X are expected to learn PC keyboard shortcuts and find Windows-compatible substitutes for software.

It is also useful to have access to a large display, or dual display configuration. If you are bringing your own laptop to class, it is recommended to bring a mouse.

## Policies

### Attendance
Students should make a serious effort to attend every lecture. While attendance is not taken, I believe **attendance is the strongest guarantor of success** in this course.

Course material is cumulative in nature and class periods are used to develop programming skills and work on projects. You will also miss out on quizzes and participation activities if you miss class.

### Lost Data
You are responsible for keeping backups/duplicates of your files. As an IU student, you should have access to a Box account. You can also use Google Drive or GitHub to maintain copies of your files. Losing your files is not an excuse for late or incomplete work.

I **highly recommend** getting a [Box](https://uits.iu.edu/box) account. It is free, helps you to stay organized, and most importantly provides **backups** for your files.

### Food and Drink in Class
Sorry, they are not permitted.

### Deadlines
Deadlines are strict and non-negotiable. Late assignments will be accepted for the first five calendar days after a deadline. After that, I will remove 10% daily. Assignments may not be submitted after five calendar days have elapsed (Example - Deadline is September 8th, you cannot submit after September 13th)

### Proper Attribution for Referenced Works
By nature, code is re-usable and extensible. It is both acceptable and encouraged to utilize and adapt examples of code; this is common on websites like StackOverflow. However, the sources for all referenced code must be given in your code commenting. I will assist students with finding code that is reusable (such as under the GNU license), and help with giving proper credit to the source.

### Students with Disabilities
If any student requires assistance or academic accommodations for a disability, please contact me by after class, by e-mail, or during office hours. The student must have established eligibility for disability support services through the Office of Disability Services for Students.

### Religious Holidays 

*It is the policy of Indiana University that instructors must reasonably accommodate students who want to observe their religious holidays at times when academic requirements conflict with those observances. This policy is intended to ensure that both faculty and students are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities in the accommodation of students' religious observances.*

### Syllabus
This course is rich in content and skill levels vary widely among students. The instructor reserves the right to amend this syllabus to better match the needs of a given class.

## Schedule
Schedule is subject to change. A given class of students can differ widely in skills and teaching needs, so our schedule is likely to be looser in the second half of the semester.
