# Project 4
## Description
You will create a p5.js sketch that incorporates various methods and techniques we've discussed so far. You encouraged to review them before beginning the project:

 * [width](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/width) and [height](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/height)
 * [mouseX](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseX) and [mouseY](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseY)
 * [line()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/line)
 * [ellipse()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse)
 * [map()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/map)
 * [constrain()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/constrain)

## Demo
This project has a [live demo](demo/index.html)

## Starter Files
You will be given two files:

 * index.html
 * sketch.js

The only file you need to modify is `sketch.js`

## Approach
I recommend having some tabs open for reference while working on this project:

* Your site in one tab
* [CodePen Week 12](http://codepen.io/collection/DBLNNB/)
* [CodePen Week 13](http://codepen.io/collection/namdpb/)
* [p5 Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)

Friendly reminder - projects can be re-submitted if students are not satisfied with their original grade. Remember that in order to receive full credit you must submit your project by the due date.

It is recommended to do as much as you can over Thanksgiving Break, and then I can help you with any difficulties after that. If you show up after Thanksgiving Break without any work done on your project, I will be very reluctant to help you.

## Grading

This project has five key components, each worth `20 points`.

|Component|Points |
| ---     |-----: | 
| Skill 1 - `width` and `height` | 20 |
| Skill 2 - `mouseX and mouseY` | 20 |
| Skill 3 - `line() and ellipse()` | 20 |
| Skill 4 - `map()` | 20 |
| Skill 5 - `constrain()` | 20 |
|**Total**|**100**|

## Requirements
#### Skill 1
Student shows understanding of `width` and `height` environment variables.

#### Skill 2
Student uses `mouseX` and `mouseY` to properly position ellipse

#### Skill 3
Student uses width/height with `line()` and the `left/right/top/bottom` variables (see starter file) to create lines that go all the way cross the canvas. These lines should run through the outer edges of the gray rectangle.

#### Skill 4
Student uses `map()` method takes `mouseX` and/or `mouseY` and maps it to background color.

#### Skill 5
Student's use of `constrain()` method keeps the ellipse inside of the inner rectangle. It's okay if your ellipse protrudes outside the rectangle somewhat; the center of the ellipse should not exceed the confines of the rectangle though. <i>(Hint: use the `r` variable to change the constrain limits)</i>


## Submission - Canvas
You will submit your project on `Canvas` in the form of a `.zip` file with this format:
`j360-lastname-firstname.zip` 

Remember **`I will deduct points`** if your file is not named correctly!

Submit your assignment on `Canvas` in the form of a `.zip` file.
