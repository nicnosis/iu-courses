**Project 1** will test students' knowledge of basic `HTML`, `MarkDown`, and `CSS`.  
This project has two parts:

(40 pts.) `Part 1` - Basic page structure with HTML and MarkDown  
(60 pts.) `Part 2` - Creating a multi-page site using HTML and CSS
	

###Part 1 - Structure

Remember that `Markup` is another word for `HTML` _(Hypertext Markup Language)_


Recall that Markdown is a tool With Markdown, using this syntax:

~~~markdown

<h2>This is an h2</h2>

<ul>
	<li>This</li>
