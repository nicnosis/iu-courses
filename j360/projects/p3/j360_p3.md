# Project 3 - Using JQuery
## Description
You will take an existing website (given to use as starter files) and modify it to add interactivity and behavior with [JQuery](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp)

The interactivity is based on assigning functionality to HTML buttons, which will initially do nothing. You will use the `.click(function(){...})` syntax to assign behavior to the buttons. 

You will not need to write/edit HTML or CSS for this project; only Javascript.

## Demo
This project has a [live demo](j360p3demo/index.html)

## Starter Files
You will be given three files:

 * index.html
 * style.css
 * script.js

The only file you need to modify is `script.js`

## Grading

This project has five parts, each worth `20 points`.

|Component|Points |
| ---     |-----: | 
| Part 1 - `.toggle()` | 20 |
| Part 2 - `.css()` | 20 |
| Part 3 - `.addClass()` | 20 |
| Part 4 - `.html()` | 20 |
| Part 5 - `.val()` | 20 |
|**Total**|**100**|

You can get `5 extra credit points` on part 3 by creating another button, that when clicked, removes the `shadow` class from the red square.

## Submission - Canvas
You will submit your project on `Canvas` in the form of a `.zip` file with this format:
`j360-lastname-firstname.zip` 

This time **`I will deduct points`** if your file is not named correctly!

Submit your assignment on `Canvas` in the form of a `.zip` file.
