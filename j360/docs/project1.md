# Project 1 - HTML&CSS
## Description
Project 1 will test your knowledge of basic HTML and CSS. You will create a basic webpage using HTML elements and CSS rules covered in class/Codecademy. Some of the concepts we will be testing are:

### HTML Tags
 * `body`
 * `head` with `link` tags
 * `h1` and other headings
 * `p` *(paragraph)*
 * `ul` and `li` *(unordered list; list items)*
 * `a` with the `href` attribute
 * `div` and `span`
 * `img` with the `src` attribute
 * `blockquote`

### CSS
 * adding Google Fonts; `font-family` and `font-size` property
 * `color`, `background-color`
 * `width` and other sizing properties
 * basic class selection

## Example
Your page should look more or less like [this](project1-solution.pdf) when you're done

## Starter File
Download the [starter file](project1-starter.zip)

## You Will Need...

 * An image. Any is fine but the example will use an image whose dimensions are approximately `800x600` pixels.
 * Lorem Ipsum text. You can use your editor to generate text, or you can use [lipsum.com](http://www.lipsum.com/)
 * [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
 * A `quotes` property for your CSS blockquote. You can copy this one:

 ```css
blockquote {
   quotes: "\201C""\201D""\2018""\2019";
}
 ```

## Tutorials
This project is designed to be completed independently by students by using YouTube tutorials I have provided. You should be able to complete the project by following the tutorials, making sure to pause and/or replay them as necessary.
