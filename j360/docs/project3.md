# Project 3 - p5.js Freestyle
## Description
Project 3 is open-ended. You will use p5.js (or any form of JavaScript) to make a creative, engaging web experience. You are allowed to build off of others' ideas and examples, or create something entirely new. The idea is to show that you have an understanding of JavaScript and p5.js, and show others that you have both technical competency and creativity.

Students with previous coding knowledge are expected to produce a more involved and complex project. The project should prove taxing regardless of whether you're a novice or experienced.

By no means do you absolutely have to use p5.js; there are plenty of other JavaScript libraries such as [d3.js](https://d3js.org) or [anime.js](http://anime-js.com/) that provide visualization mechanisms. However, if you are a beginner it's recommended to use p5 since it's covered in class.

## Ideation
Before actually beginning the assignment, you are expected to review some examples and come up with an idea. It is helpful if you have some __pseudocode__. Pseudocode is informal, conceptual design written in a way that reads like English, but honors programming constructs. An example might help:

##### Code:
```js
if (mouseIsPressed) {
    fill(255, 0, 0); // red
}
```
##### Pseudocode:
```js
if (user is clicking) then fill(red) 
```

### Submission for Ideation

## Examples
This list is by no means exhaustive, but should give a starting point. You don't necessarily have to duplicate/copy any of these projects; it's more for inspiration and ideas.

 * [CodingTrain Coding Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH) - this is a list of videos by [Dan Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/). Most of these projects use p5.js
 * [Official p5 examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) - There is a lot of excellent starting code here! You can use it as long as you cite it somewhere in your projects
 * [inconvergent](http://inconvergent.net/)

### Twitter feeds
Following the creative work of others on Twitter or similar platforms is a great way to get ideas and inspiration.

## Grading
In grading, you are awarded points for:

* __Ideation__ - Did you spend time reviewing and analyzing examples? Is your idea actionable?
* __Rigor__ - Students are expected to select an idea that is challenging to their abilities and demands appropriate time and effort.
* __Aesthetics__ - Your project should be polished, presentable, and have the level of quality that an employer or client might expect.
* __Code Quality__ - Your code should be well organized. Did you indent your code properly? Are your variable names sensible and self-descriptive? Is your code thoroughly commented? Others should be able to look at your code and build off of it.

| Component    |  Points |
|:-------------|--------:|
| Ideation     |      25 |
| Rigor        |      25 |
| Aesthetics   |      25 |
| Code Quality |      25 |
| **Total**    | **100** |

Blatant copy-and-pasting of code or plagiarism will result in a failing grade. You are allowed to look at other programmers' code, but you must cite your source somewhere.

## Submission
After you are done writing code, you can upload the entire folder to your site. The best way is to drag and drop the entire folder.

Submit the link to your assignment on Canvas.
