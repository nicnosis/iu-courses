# Project 3 - p5.js Freestyle
## Description
Project 3 is open-ended. You will use p5.js (or any form of JavaScript) to make a creative, engaging web experience. You are allowed to build off of others' ideas and examples, or create something entirely new. The idea is to show that you have an understanding of JavaScript and p5.js, and show others that you have both technical competency and creativity.

Students with previous coding knowledge are expected to produce a more involved and complex project. The project should prove taxing regardless of whether you're a novice or experienced.

By no means do you absolutely have to use p5.js; there are plenty of other JavaScript libraries such as [d3.js](https://d3js.org) or [anime.js](http://anime-js.com/) that provide visualization mechanisms. However, if you are a beginner it's recommended to use p5 since it's covered in class.

## p5 Skills - Methods and Variables
You must use a combination of __at least five__ p5.js methods or variables. Examples of methods are `map()`, `constrain()`, `push()/pop()`, `translate()`, `rotate()`, and `random()` to name a few. Examples of variables are `width/height`, `mouseX/mouseY`, `frameCount`, and `mouseIsPressed`.

You should look at the [p5.js documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/) to come up with ideas of what skills you will use.

Because this assignment is open-ended, your use of p5 skills will constitute a significant part of your grade.

## Ideation
Before actually beginning the assignment, you are expected to review some examples and come up with an idea. Your idea can be very general; if you say _"I want to make a sketch where colorful circles appear when the user clicks,"_ that's totally fine with me.

  <div class="card-block">
    <h4 class="card-title">Submit Idea</h4>
    <p class="card-text">You will use a Google Form to submit your idea. The sooner you submit an idea, the sooner I will be able to help you.</p>

## Ideas and Examples
This list is by no means exhaustive, but should give a starting point. You don't necessarily have to duplicate/copy any of these projects; it's more for inspiration and ideas.

 * [CodingTrain Coding Challenges](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH) - this is a list of videos by [Dan Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/). Most of these projects use p5.js
 * [Official p5 examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) - There is a lot of excellent starting code here! You can use it as long as you cite it somewhere in your projects
 * [p5 reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) - This is a comprehensive list of variables and methods in the library. You can find plenty of starter code here and get ideas for what is possible.
 * [p5 libraries](https://p5js.org/libraries/) - There's a lot more you can do with p5, they are listed here
 * [p5 DOM](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.dom) - This allows you to create interface elements to interact with your sketch. For example, sliders that control color.
 * [p5 sound](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) - You can control sound input/output with this library.
 * [p5.play](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/) - A library for making games with p5.js
 * [perlin noise](http://genekogan.com/code/p5js-perlin-noise/) - excellent article on Perlin noise with p5js. This is a fun way to introduce randomization
 * [inconvergent](http://inconvergent.net/) - Generative artwork with JavaScript
 * [Gallery of Computation](http://www.complexification.net/gallery/) - Generate art made with Processing

## Grading
In grading, you are awarded points for:

* __Skills__ - You must employ several methods/variables from the __p5.js__ library. If you are not using p5.js, then you will be evaluated more leniently for this part. You should have a combination of at least five p5 methods/variables.
* __Ideation__ - Did you spend time reviewing and analyzing examples? Is your idea actionable? You will be awarded more points if it is evident that you took time to brainstorm and think about your project before beginning.
* __Rigor__ - Is this project challenging for your level of skill? Is your project a carbon copy of somebody else's work, or did you innovate and make changes? __Rigor__ is the perceived level of difficulty for this project - it should be challenging, but realistic given the time frame.
* __Aesthetics__ - Your project should be polished, presentable, and have the level of quality that an employer or client might expect.
* __Code Quality__ - Your code should be well organized. Did you indent your code properly? Are your variable names sensible and self-descriptive? Is your code thoroughly commented? Others should be able to look at your code and build off of it. Your project should follow conventions covered in class and be free of error-prone or unnecessary code.

### Points

| Component    |  Points |
|:-------------|--------:|
| Skills       |      40 |
| Ideation     |      20 |
| Rigor        |      20 |
| Aesthetics   |      10 |
| Code Quality |      10 |
| **Total**    | **100** |

Blatant copy-and-pasting of code or plagiarism will result in a failing grade. Plagiarism occurs in copying and pasting code without giving proper attribution somewhere in your project. You are allowed to look at other programmers' code, but you must cite your source somewhere.

## Submission
After you are done writing code, you can upload the entire folder to your site. The best way is to drag and drop the entire folder.

Submit the link to your project on Canvas.
