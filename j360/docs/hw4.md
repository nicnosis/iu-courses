# Homework 4 - p5.js map() and constrain()
## Description
You will create a p5.js sketch that incorporates various drawing methods and techniques, with a focus on understanding the coordinate system. You are encouraged to review them before beginning the project:

 * [width](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/width) and [height](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/height)
 * [mouseX](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseX) and [mouseY](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/mouseY)
 * [line()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/line)
 * [ellipse()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse)
 * [map()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/map)
 * [constrain()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/constrain)

## Demo
This project has a [live demo](demo/hw4)

## Starter Files
You will be given two files:

 * index.html
 * sketch.js

The only file you need to modify is `sketch.js`

Download here - [Project 4 Starter Files](hw4-starter.zip)

## Approach
I recommend having some tabs open for reference while working on this project:

* Your homework in one tab
* Demo in one tab
* [p5 Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) in another

Friendly reminder - projects can be re-submitted if students are not satisfied with their original grade. Remember that in order to receive full credit you must submit your project by the due date.

## Grading

This project has five key components, each worth `20 points`

| Component                        |  Points |
|:---------------------------------|--------:|
| Skill 1 - `width` and `height`   |      20 |
| Skill 2 - `mouseX and mouseY`    |      20 |
| Skill 3 - `line() and ellipse()` |      20 |
| Skill 4 - `map()`                |      20 |
| Skill 5 - `constrain()`          |      20 |
| **Total**                        | **100** |

## Requirements
#### Skill 1
Student shows understanding of `width` and `height` environment variables.

#### Skill 2
Student uses `mouseX` and `mouseY` to properly position ellipse

#### Skill 3
Student uses width/height with `line()` and the `left/right/top/bottom` variables (see starter file) to create lines that go all the way cross the canvas. These lines should run through the outer edges of the gray rectangle.

#### Skill 4
Student uses `map()` method takes `mouseX` and/or `mouseY` and maps it to background color.

#### Skill 5
Student's use of `constrain()` method keeps the ellipse inside of the inner rectangle. It's okay if your ellipse protrudes outside the rectangle somewhat; the center of the ellipse should not exceed the confines of the rectangle though. _(Hint: use the `r` variable to change the constrain limits)_


## Submission - Canvas
After you are done writing code, you can upload the entire folder to your site. The best way is to drag and drop the entire folder.

Submit the link to your assignment on Canvas.
