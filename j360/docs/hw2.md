# Homework 2 - jQuery
## Description
You will take an existing website (given to use as starter files) and modify it to add interactivity and behavior with [JQuery](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp)

The interactivity is based on assigning functionality to HTML buttons, which will initially do nothing. You will use the `.click(function(){...})` syntax to assign behavior to the buttons.

You will not need to write/edit HTML or CSS for this assignment; only Javascript.

## Demo
This project has a [live demo](demo/hw2/)

## Starter Files
You will be given three files:

 * index.html
 * styles.css
 * script.js

The only file you need to modify is `script.js`

## Approach
This assignment will be much easier if you write down the selectors you need for each part. For each part you will have a button selector, and another selector. E.g., for part one you will need `$("#btn1")` (the button) and `$("#part1")` (the square div).

I recommend having some tabs open for reference while working on this project:

* Your site in one tab
* [JQuery Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp)
* Your Codepen exercises


## Grading

This project has five parts, each worth `20 points`.

| Component              | Points  |
|:-----------------------|:--------|
| Part 1 - `.toggle()`   | 20      |
| Part 2 - `.css()`      | 20      |
| Part 3 - `.addClass()` | 20      |
| Part 4 - `.html()`     | 20      |
| Part 5 - `.val()`      | 20      |
| **Total**              | **100** |

You can get `5 extra credit points` on part 3 by creating another button, that when clicked, removes the `shadow` class from the red square.

## Submission - Canvas
After you are done writing code, you can upload the entire folder to your site. The best way is to drag and drop the entire folder.

Submit the link to your assignment on Canvas.
