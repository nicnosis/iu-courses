# Project 4 - Profile
## Description
You will use Bootstrap to create a profile for a person, place, business, or event. If you are doing a person, it can be a historical figure, favorite musical artist, celebrity, etc. If you are doing a place, you might choose a prominent location, popular vacation spot, or interesting historical site.

The idea is to create an attractive, one-page site that gives users an overview of your chosen topic.

#### Topics
Recommended topics are:
 * A favorite historical figure
 * Your favorite band
 * An upcoming show/gig/concert
 * A menu for a restaurant
 * A popular vacation spot
 * A venue/bar/club

## Writing content
__DO NOT PLAGIARIZE__. If you are going to use text, word-for-word, from another person's site, you must give credit.

+ bootstrap examples

+ bootstrap theme

+ google font

+ img circle responsive

## Grading
You are awarded points for:

* __Layout and hierarchy__ - You should make use of Bootstrap's [grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/grid/) to create an enticing visual layout.
* __Aesthetics__ - Your project should have a clean and aesthetic appearance. Your site should be free of any distracting, noisy/busy or unnecessary visual elements. Use of colors and visual style should create a pleasant experience for the user.
* __Typography__ - Your project should use at least one web font, such as those from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Attention to detail is expected when it comes to font-weight, size, spacing, margins, etc. Text should be optimized for readability; e.g., important text should be BIG and less important text should be small
* __Image__ - You should have a circular image that fits nicely in the page. If your image is distorted, of poor resolution, or doesn't display correctly, you will lose points. Your `img` tag should also have the appropriate classes specified in this rubric.
* __Code Quality__ - Your code should be well organized. Did you indent your code properly? Are your variable names sensible and self-descriptive? Is your code thoroughly commented? Others should be able to look at your code and build off of it. Your project should follow conventions covered in class and be free of error-prone or unnecessary code.
