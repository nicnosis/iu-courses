<h1>Using Atom</h1>

<h2>Download Atom</h2>

<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are absolutely worth learning. If you take some time to learn them, it will make your life much easier.</p>

<h2>Tips for File Management</h2>
<p>
    Do:
<ul>
    <li>Make a folder to keep all your work in for this class. Call it <code>j360</code> or something similar.</li>
    <li>Use the 'column view' in the Finder (Mac Users)</li>
    <li>Use the 'list view' in Windows Explorer (PC Users)</li>
    <li>Keep backups of your files. You are expected to use a service like Google Drive or Box to maintain your work.</li>
</ul>
Don't:
<ul>
    <li>Keep all of your stuff on your <code>desktop</code></li>
    <li>Keep only one copy of your work. You should have your files backed up in at least one place</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
<p>
    Use short, descriptive filenames. Avoid capital letters and spaces. <code>My Project.html</code> is a poor file name. <code>my-project.html</code> is a better file name.
