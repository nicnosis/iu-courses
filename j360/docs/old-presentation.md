# Presentation

## Description
You will give an informal presentation, 3-5 minutes in length, about a topic related to web design. While this course covers a lot of material, it only begins to scratch the surface of web development and computer programming. The idea behind these presentations is that students will do some research about a subject related to web design and share it with others. Be prepared to answer any questions that other students and the instructor may have.

## Format
It is recommended that you either hook your laptop up to the classroom monitor (via HDMI cable) or use the lab computer to project. You can use PowerPoint slides if you like, but it isn't required. You are much more likely to do well on the presentation if you come with some example code prepared.

You are not required to dress formally; casual attire is fine.

## Subject Matter
Anything loosely related to what we've covered in the course is acceptable. Anything that relates to HTML/CSS/JavaScript and their variants is fine. Any topic on the subject of general computer programming - whether it be in Python, Java, C++, etc. - is also useful.

If you are unsure about if your topic is okay, or you are having trouble thinking of a topic, just ask me.

I have provided a list of topics that should provide more than enough starting points. You do not need to know everything about the topic, but you should be able to provide students with a basic overview of the topic. You do not need to provide code, but a **working code demonstration will almost certainly guarantee you an A**. Providing a tutorial; something actionable and useful to other students; is also a strong guarantor of success. You can also showcase applications and/or features for an application - for example, showing how to install and use a useful SublimeText plug-in.

Making a GitHub repo with (functional) code for your presentation will also help you get a better grade.

## Submission
You may present on any day up to and including the last day of class, **Wednesday, April 26th**. There is a Google Sheet that you will use to sign up.

On the presentation sign-up sheet, you must fill in two parts

1. Your desired timeslot, with your name or initials
2. Your topic, so that nobody else can present on the same thing

It is __your responsibility__ to make sure you are presenting on a topic that hasn't been claimed yet.

The presentation will appear on Canvas, but you don't have to do anything there.
