# j360 - Homework 1
## Description
Homework 1 is designed to test your ability to upload an HTML file to your site. For most students, this means setting up an FTP _(File Transfer Protocol)_ connection with your IUPages or asmallorange account.

This assignment is pretty straightforward - you will download a template file, make some small changes, and upload it to your site.

## Download
Download this file - [hw1-starter.zip](hw1-starter.zip) and unzip it.

## Modify
The download should unzip to a folder called `my-site`. You can rename this folder and use it to keep the files that you are hosting on your site.

You will see a file named `hw1.html`. This is the file you will modify and upload.

Make the following changes:

 * Add this text to the `<title>` tag: "j360 - homework 1"
 * Create an `<h1>` element that contains your name

## Connect and Upload

#### Get an FTP client
You will need a program, called an FTP client, that establishes a connection with your site, allowing you to upload files.

OSX users - Download [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)  
PC Users - Download [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) or [Putty](http://www.putty.org/)

#### Get an FTP Account
You will need a username and password that you use with your FTP client to connect to your site. This is basically a set of credentials that allows you to move files onto the web server that hosts your site.

If you are using IU Pages - your IU username will be your login, and you should be issued a password that you can use.

#### Connect
OSX Users, see [this article](https://kb.iu.edu/d/akom) on using Cyberduck.  
PC Users, see [this article](https://kb.iu.edu/d/bfoc) on using WinSCP.

If you are using asmallorange - read [this article](https://kb.asmallorange.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1806237-create-an-ftp-account-in-cpanel)

#### Upload
On your account, you will usually have a folder called either `www` or `public_html`. Anything you put in there will be hosted on your site.

On your computer, navigate to your `my-site` folder (or whatever you renamed it to) and upload your `hw1.html` file


## Submission
Homework 1 is due __Friday, February 3rd__

You will submit on Canvas. All you need to do is link to your website, where the `hw1.html` file is located. Your submission link might look something like this: `mywebsite.com/j360/hw1.html`
