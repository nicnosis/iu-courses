# Project Three--- Bootstrap Site
## Description
For Project Three, you will apply all of the skills you've learned throughout the semester to create a website with Bootstrap.

You have two options; you can either build:

1. a `portfolio` site for yourself
2. a `landing page` for a fictitious app

## Option 1--- Portfolio
You will build a portfolio site to showcase your work. Focus on building a portfolio that communicates skills and interests to potential employers.

Given the nature of your desired profession--- journalist, photographer, designer, artist--- your portfolio site can vary greatly in layout and content. You might create a one-page site, or you might have several pages.

### Inspiration
I recommend having a strong vision of what you want your portfolio to look like before you begin. I have included some helpful links to strong portfolio examples:


 * Awwwards collection: [agency portfolios](https://www.awwwards.com/awwwards/collections/agency-portfolios/)
 * Awwwards collection: [freelance portfolios](https://www.awwwards.com/awwwards/collections/freelance-portfolio/)
 * Pinterest search: ['portfolio website'](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=portfolio+website)
 * Pinterest board: [Portfolio website templates](https://www.pinterest.com/ibrandstudio/portfolio-website-templates/). _(Note that you consult templates for ideas, but you may not use the template itself without permission.)_
 * Pinterest board: [PORTFOLIO WEBSITE](https://www.pinterest.com/marciabarton/portfolio-website/)
 * Behance search: ['web design'](https://www.behance.net/search?content=projects&sort=appreciations&time=week&search=web%20design)
 * dribbble search: ['portfolio layout'](https://dribbble.com/search?q=portfolio+layout)

### Requirements
If you're building a portfolio site, you must fulfill these requirements:

1. __hero__ section--- this should contain a graphical element such as a hero image
2. __about__ section--- simple section with an image and description to let people know who you are.
3. __work__ section--- you should have at least two pieces of work to showcase on your portfolio. These can be anything you've worked on _(photographs, writing, graphic design, web design, etc.)_

## Option 2--- App Landing Page
A `landing page` is a site used to promote a product or service. For this option, you will create a landing page for a fictional app.

### Inspiration
I recommend looking through some of these examples to get inspiration.

 * Awwwards collection: [Product pages](https://www.awwwards.com/awwwards/collections/product-page/)
 * Pinterest search: ['landing page'](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=landing+page)
 * Pinterest board: [Landing Pages](https://www.pinterest.com/rondesignlab/landing-page/)
 * Pinterest board: [Best Responsive Landing Page Template](https://www.pinterest.com/noozy/best-responsive-landing-page-template/). _(Note that you consult templates for ideas, but you may not use the template itself without permission.)_
 * Pinterest board: [Promo Sites & Landing Pages](https://www.pinterest.com/jvetrau/promo-sites-landing-pages/)
 * Behance search: ['landing page'](https://www.behance.net/search?field=102&content=projects&sort=appreciations&time=week&search=landing%20page). Make sure to filter by `'web design'`
 * dribbble search: ['landing page'](https://dribbble.com/search?q=landing+page)

### Requirements
If you are choosing to make an app landing page. You must have:

1. __hero__ section--- this should contain a graphical element such as a hero image, or a prototype/mockup of your fictitious app.
2. __description__ or __features__ section--- combination of text or images to give the user an idea of what the app is about.
3. __call to action__--- This should be a section with commercial intent. Examples might include:
  * A pricing table with options
  * A section that invites the user to contact you, or follow on social media
  * A section that invites the user to __download__ the app or __subscribe__ to the service


## Timeline
You are expected to have certain amounts of work done at regular intervals. I want to be able to see your work regularly to ensure that you are making adequate progress.

### Milestone 1: Site skeleton `Wed Nov 29`
At this point you should have some simple code written to determine the general __layout and structure__ of your site. This will include things like making a `container` div and creating divs for each major `section` of your site.

### Milestone 2: Populating content `Wed Dec 6`
At this point, you should have most of your site's content ready. From this point forward, you should focus on refining the appearance and clarity of your site.

## Academic Integrity
You are allowed to use existing code from sources such as Bootstrap's documentation site. However, you must always reference code that you have taken from another source.

Many of the inspiration links will feature templates. Note that although you can consult templates to get ideas, __you may not build your final site with a template__ unless you have __explicit permission from the instructor__.

To clarify, here is the extent of what is allowed and what isn't:

### Allowed
 * Talking to a classmate to get ideas or suggestions
 * Looking at another student's code to identify bugs or problems
 * Including plugins or small code snippets from online, provided that they aren't templates, and that you cited the source.
 * Example--- you might build your navigation using code from the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/). This is fine.

### Not Allowed
 * Writing code for another student
 * Copying/pasting code between students
 * Sharing files between students
 * Copying/pasting code from online examples __without giving credit__
 * Using a Boostrap template __without the instructor's permission__

`If any two students have code that is more than 75% identical, both students will receive a grade of 0.`

## Grading
Project Three is worth `35 points`.

| criterion   |   | pts |
|:------------|:--|:----|
|             |   |     |
| Milestone 1 |   | 3   |
| Milestone 2 |   | 3   |
|             |   |     |


## Submission--- Canvas
You have two options.

### Option one--- Submit a zip file
1. Make sure your project folder is named `project3_lastname-firstname`.
2. Right-click on your site folder and choose `compress`.
3. Make sure the file is called `project3_lastname-firstname.zip`

Submit your compressed file _(zip)_ to: `CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > PROJECT 3`

### Option two--- Submit a link
Host your site online, and submit a URL to the site. Remember that your site will be live, and any changes made will be reflected on the site when I go to grade it.

#### **Due Wed Dec 13th at 11:59pm**
#### Because this is the final project, **I cannot accept late work**
