# Project Two - <small>Layouts with CSS `15 points`</small>
## Description
You will use CSS `flexbox` to create a layout for a fictional online shop. This can be almost anything you want - clothing store, sports gear, hotels/vacation. You can also expand on your pizza website from Homework Two if you like; you are encouraged to re-use and modify existing code wherever possible.

<div class="card-block">
  <p class="card-text">I've created an example shoe store website as a reference:</p>
  <a href="../examples/shoes/" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">View Example</a>
</div>

This project may appear daunting at first, but if you are motivated to work on it regularly over the next few weeks, you will do well. I will cover many of the components during class activities so that you have some example code to work with.

#### Using code from references
You are allowed to get code from places like W3Schools.com and css-tricks.com. However, you MUST CITE the source in your code if you plan to do this.

Example:

```html
     <!-- from W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/css/some-link.asp-->
     <div class="container">
         ...
     </div>
```

### Flexbox Reference
Flexbox is a useful way of organizing CSS elements and creating layouts. You are encouraged to consult these guides:

 * [Scotch.io Visual Guide to Flexbox](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties)
 * [Scotch.io Flexbox Playground](https://demos.scotch.io/visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-flexbox-playground/demos/)
 * [W3 Guide to Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)


## Starter Files
You are given some starter files.

<div class="card-block">
  <p class="card-text">Starter files for Homework Two.</p>
  <a href="p2-starter.zip" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">Download</a>
</div>

## Components
### 1 - Navigation `2 pts.`
You must have a navigation bar with a few links on it. These links don't need to be functional.
You can also consult [this guide](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp) from W3Schools for ideas.

### 2 - Hero Image `3 pts.`
Your site will have a _hero image_. This means a large, visually engaging photograph at the top of your site. You should put the _(fictitious)_ name of the site across the top.

<img src="img/ex-hero.png" width="300">

You may use [this guide](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hero_image.asp) from W3Schools as a useful starting point.

#### Getting an image
You can get your images from anywhere. You may find [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) or Google Images helpful. With Google Images, you can search by size, which may be helpful.

### 3 - Items `3 pts.`
Your shop should have a list of items:

<img src="img/ex-items.png" width="300">

### 4 -

### Text
You can use [lorem ipsum]() placeholder text, or fill in text as you see fit. The idea of this assignment is to create a prototype; something that communicates a strong idea of a finished product.

### File and folder names `2 pt`
 * DO NOT use spaces in your filenames. Use hyphens instead
 * DO NOT use capital letters in your filenames
 * Your site folder should be named `hw2_lastname-firstname` _(e.g., hw2_aguirre-nicolas)_
 * You will submit a `.zip` file. Right-click on your site folder and choose `compress`. Make sure this file is called `hw2_lastname-firstname.zip`

### Code Quality `2 pts.`
Your code should:

 * Be free of extraneous whitespaces
 * Use proper indentation to show structure with nested tags - It should be easy to read for me
 * Follow conventions described in class and in the reading _(e.g., do not capitalize tags, use quotation marks when specifying an attribute)_


## Submission - Canvas
Submit your compressed file _(zip)_ to: `CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > PROJECT 2`
