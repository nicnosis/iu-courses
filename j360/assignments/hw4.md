# Homework Four --- Planning your final
## Description
For this homework, you will plan out your final project. The goal is to have a tangible vision of the complete project, so that coding it will be much easier.

Your final project is a website made with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). You have one of two options:

1. A portfolio site that showcases your work
2. A promotional site for a fictional app

Once you decide, you will create a wireframe; a rough sketch that conveys the idea of your finished site.

## Inspiration
You should be familiar with wireframing from our in-class activity.

I recommend looking over examples of wireframes before beginning. You might find these useful:

 * [20 Inspiring Examples of Web and Mobile Wireframe Sketches](https://speckyboy.com/web-mobile-wireframe-sketch-examples/)
 * [wireframes.tumblr.com](http://wireframes.tumblr.com/)
 * [Pinterest - wireframes](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=wireframes)
 * [Behance - wireframes](https://www.behance.net/search?field=132&content=projects&sort=appreciations&time=week&search=wireframes)

## Requirements
You will deliver two things:

1. A desktop wireframe sketch
2. A mobile wireframe sketch

However you would like to make these is fine--- You can create them in Illustrator, draw them by hand, or use a prototyping software like [Axure](https://www.axure.com/).

## Template files
You are free to sketch out wireframes for your site by hand, but you can also use some of these starter files:

 <div class="card-block">
    <h4 class="card-title">Template: Wireframes</h4>
    <div class="spacer-1rem"></div>
    <a href="wireframes.pdf" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">Download</a>
  </div>

I suggest printing off a few copies of each template page and drawing your ideas out until you find a layout that you like.


## Submission--- Hand-in
Unlike our previous assignments, for this one you will `hand in a hard copy`. __Make sure your name is on it.__
