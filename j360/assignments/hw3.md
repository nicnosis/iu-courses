# Homework Three - <small>Bootstrap three column layout</small>
## Description
You will make a simple, three-column responsive layout using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). I will give you the necessary images, placeholder text, and starter files. You will write the HTML to set up the layout.

Here's what it should look like...
<div class="card-block">
  <p class="card-text">Finished site:</p>
  <a href="../examples/cakes.png" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">View Example</a>
</div>

## Starter Files
You are given some starter files.
<div class="card-block">
  <p class="card-text">Starter files for Homework Three.</p>
  <a href="hw3.zip" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank">Download</a>
</div>

### About these files
 * `example.png` is just there as a reference.
 * `index.html` is where you will do almost all of your work.
 * `words.txt` file has the text you need. You can copy and paste this. Remember if you right-click on a file in the sidebar of Atom, you can choose to `split` the view so you can see both files.
 * The `img` folder has all the images you need--- three cakes and a hero image.

### CSS
You will have to:

1. Use a `<link>` tag to connect your `styles.css` in `index.html`
2. Set a `background-image` property on the `#hero` selector in `styles.css`. This will set your hero image.

No other CSS is necessary, but you can add additional styling if you like.

### Bootstrap classes you need
 * `container`--- Open it at the start of the `body`, close just before you see the `<script>` tags.
 * `jumbotron`--- this will be your hero section
 * `display-4`--- for making the `h1` display text
 * `row`--- for the main section, put columns in here
 * `col-sm-4`--- This will be a 1/3-width, column that gets stacked on small displays
 * `img-responsive`--- Put this on your `img` tags so they resize properly
 * `lead`--- Put this on your paragraphs so they have larger text.

### Bootstrap reference
You will probably need to know about:

 * [Bootstrap grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/)
 * [Bootstrap typography](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/) for display text and `lead` paragraphs
 * [Bootstrap components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/) _(e.g., jumbotron)_

## Submission - Canvas
Compress your folder when finished. It should be named `hw3_lastname-firstname.zip`.

Submit your compressed file _(zip)_ to: `CANVAS > ASSIGNMENTS > HOMEWORK 3`
